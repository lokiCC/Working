The decision to avoid a middle class mediocrity lead to quest that brought out the hero's flaw. The start of an adventure, an Odyssey you call it. A chance to find a purpose maybe? A chance to find an identity perhaps one the hardest goals a person who has been stricken of the moments that define our relation to one another and thrust into a materialistic ecosystem that does not define the individual rather it brings attention to the other. 

Seeking a counter-culture seems exactly the thing an individual would do, I know because it's what I did. What obsessions are at the root of your thoughts; the thoughts that keep you running from the part of you that found some normal along the way.
