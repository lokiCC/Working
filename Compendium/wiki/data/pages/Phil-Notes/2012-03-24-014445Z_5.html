<p>&ldquo;oh my friends! I wish your self were in the deed like the mother is in the child: let that be your word on virtue!&rdquo; (p.74)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirit is life that itself cuts into life; by its own agony it increases its own knowledge – did you know that?&rdquo; (p.80)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no eagles thus you have not experienced the happiness in the terror of the spirit. And whoever is not a bird should not build nests over abysses.&rdquo; (p.81)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the sail, trembling with vehemence of the spirit, my wisdom goes over the sea – my wild wisdom!&rdquo; (p.81)</p>

<p>&ldquo;My eye no longer wells up at the shame of those who beg; my hand became too hard for the trembling of filled hands.</p>

<pre><code>Where have the tears of my eye and the down of my heart gone? Oh loneliness of all bestowers! Oh muteness of all who shine!" (p.82)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;   Into your eye I gazed recently, oh life! And then into the unfathomable I seemed to sink.</p>

<pre><code>But you pulled me out with your golden fishing rod; you laughed mockingly when I called you unfathomable." (p.84) This passage is really quite amazing.***
