<p>I received an email and it started off with this.
“Dear Consultant,
Hope you doing great.
Kindly find the job description given below and if you interested for this position please reply me back.
Kindly reply with your contact details”</p>

<p>Now normally, I wouldn’t think twice about someone’s grammar. If a person is not a good writer or knowledgeable about grammar, it is only really that person effected. Today, it was different. This email was an inquiry sent to me about a potential position. The grammar mistakes could be simply just that a mistake, but the error and the fact that it’s repeated implies; one the author did not reread there email and two English may be the author’s second language. Frankly, the error suggests any number of things. However, I internally made a judgment, an assumption really, that the author didn’t reread the email, that many emails have been sent out or that the author is Foreign. For me, my thoughts, judgement, and decisions stop there.  I’m not concerned about any of those possibilities.</p>

<p>The position is for a job in California so I replied simply that I was not currently interested in the position. However, I gained a much deeper appreciation for the need to reread and check for grammar mistakes.</p></div>
