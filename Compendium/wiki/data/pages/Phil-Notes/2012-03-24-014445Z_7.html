<p>&ldquo;And Zarathustra walked on pensively, farther and deeper through the woods and past swampy valleys; but as happens to anyone who reflects on grave matters, he unintentionally stepped on someone.&rdquo;(p.200) [I really thought this was a rather funny line. It&rsquo;s a play on words but I enjoyed it]</p>

<p>&ldquo;– this is why I threw away everything else, this is why all else is the same to me; and right next to my knowledge my black ignorance lurks.&rdquo; (p.202)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You outcast, who cast himself out, you no longer want to dwell among human beings and human pity? Well then, do as I do! Thus you&rsquo;ll also learn from me; only the doer learns.&rdquo;(p.216)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   "What am I seeking here?&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;The same thing you seek, you trouble maker! Namely happiness on earth.&rdquo;&ldquo;(p.217)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   And truly, what profit is it a man if he gains the whole word, and did not learn this one thing, chewing the cud: what would it help? He would not be rid of his misery</p>

<pre><code>–his great misery: which today is called nausea. Who today does not have heart, mouth and eyes full of nausea? You too! You too! But just look at these cows here!" – (p.217) [chew the cud is a phrase meaning to further digest or to think or talk reflectively.]
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;   "Then you learned,&rdquo; Zarathustra interrupted the speaker, &ldquo;how it is harder to grant right than to take right, and that bestowing well is an art and the ultimate , craftiest master-art of kindness.&rdquo;&ldquo;(p.218)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lascivious greed, galling envy, aggrieved vengefulness, rabble pride: all of that leaped into my face. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed. But the kingdom of heaven is among the cows.&rdquo; (p.218)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   To such restless ones as you even a jail ends up looking like bliss. Have you ever seen how captured criminals sleep? They sleep peacefully, they enjoy their new security.</p>

<pre><code>Beware that you are not captured in the end by a narrow belief, a harsh, severe delusion! Because now you are seduced and tempted by anything that is narrow and solid.
You have lost your goal: indeed, how will you get rid of and get over this loss? Along with it - you have also lost your way!" (p.222)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely the least, the softest, the lightest, a lizard&rsquo;s rustling, a breath, a wink, a blink of an eye – a little is the stuff of the best happiness. Still!&rdquo;(p.224)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Once again he heard the great cry of distress. And, amazingly, this time it came from his own cave! But it was a protracted, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra clearly differentiated that it was composed of many voices; even if, heard from a distance, it sounded like the cry of a single mouth.&rdquo;(p.225)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my home and house no one shall despair; in my territory I protect everyone from his wild animals. And that is the first thing I offer you: security!&rdquo; (p.226)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more delightful grows on earth, oh Zarathustra, than a tall, strong will: that is the earths most beautiful plant. An entire landscape is invigorated by one such tree.&rdquo; (p.227)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   –for what is on its way to you is nothing less than the last remnant of God among human beings, that is: all human beings of great longing, of great nausea, of great surfeit,</p>

<pre><code>–all who do not want to live unless they once again learn to hope – unless they learn from you, oh Zarathustra, the great hope!" (p.228)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Cold souls, mules, the blind, the drunk – these I do not call brave of heart. Whoever has heart knows fear, but conquers fear; sees the abyss, but with pride.&rdquo; (p.233)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freedom from fever is by no means knowledge! I do not believe spirits that have cooled down. Whoever cannot lie does not know what truth is.&rdquo; (p.235)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is better to be foolish with happiness than foolish with unhappiness, better to dance ponderously than to walk lamely. So learn this wisdom from me: even the worst thing has two good reverse sides –&rdquo; (p.239)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear, after all – that is a human being&rsquo;s original and basic feeling; from fear everything can be explained, original sin and original virtue. From fear my virtue also grew, it is called: science&rdquo; (p.246) [Zarathustra disputes this claim. Same page]</p>

<p>Zarathustra song:</p>

<pre><code>"Oh mankind, pray!
What does deep midnight have to say?
"From sleep, from sleep –
From deepest dream I made my way: –
The world is deep,
And deeper than the grasp of day.
Deep is its pain –,
Joy – deeper still than misery:
Pain says: Refrain!
Yet all joy wants eternity –
–Wants deep, wants deep eternity." "(p.264)
