<p>&ldquo;Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made today! It is not a man he hath caught, but a corpse.&rdquo; (150) (Direct Quote from Zarathustra)</p>

<pre><code>"We must pay attention to this sentence. It is important, because later on comes the realization that he needs other people just because he has not caught a man."(150)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;You see, if the corpse is himself, then he is dead really, and he has to replace himself by the other people he catches–or one could almost say, by other corpses. They must be, then, instead of himself; he hands over to others his human life which he should have lived. Therefore, he says that human existence is uncanny and without a meaning.&rdquo;(150)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inasmuch as this archetype was obvious to them at all, it appeared only as a jester or a corpse, a being which would either make a man insane or kill him. But Zarathustra is not only the archetype; he contains the self at the same time and is therefore an exceedingly superior figure.&rdquo;(150)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The archetype is a collective thing; it is by its definition a content of the collective unconscious. It is an omnipresent eternal figure which one encounters everywhere, while the self is not to be encountered everywhere. The self is, by definition, the most individual thing, the essence of individuality. It is the uniqueness. And that one can only encounter &hellip; Only in yourself. You cannot even encounter it in anybody else, only in yourself.&rdquo; (151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The self is the immediate awareness of your uniqueness, and it is a uniqueness which is in a way most personal, most intimate.&rdquo; (151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, we always have to keep in mind that the self is in the first place the personal Atman–to use the Indian formulation of that concept. But their definition is that the personal Atman, the self, is in everybody; it is the smallest thing, the thumbling in the heart of everybody, yet it is the greatest thing in the world, the super-personal Atman, the general collective Atman. And we can accept that definition. It can be grasped intellectually even by an occidental mind. Yet it is not grasped properly at all, because the super-personal Atman is not the thumbling in everybody. It is the thumbling in myself. There is only the self, and that is my self, for by definition the personal Atman is uniqueness.&rdquo;(151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, take the worship of a mandala, not like these chakras on the wall which represent evolution, but a mandala of completion, a Lamaistic chakra, where in the center there is either the thunderbolt, the vajra, the abstract symbol of concentrated divine power, or Shiva and Shakti in embrace.[1] When the Tantric initiant enters the center of the mandala through the four gates of the functions,[2] it is understood that he approaches the god, which in the philosophy of the Upanishads would be the super-personal Absolute Atman. In other words, the initiant brings the personal Atman back to its divine source, the super-personal Atman. In the end, when he has entered through the four gates and has reached the center, then the climax of the contemplation would be the complete identity of the initiant with the god–if he is a man, with the Shiva, and if a woman, with the Shakti, the female aspect of the god. The two aspects merge finally into one, in the non-existing yet existing Brahma, the potential world being. Now, in this case an individual self has become the universal self, yet when you approach the universal self through the personal, you carry the individual consciousness into the unconsciousness. Then the universal consciousness is identical with the individual consciousness; there the self in all its particularity, in all its peculiar personal being, is at the same time the universal being.&rdquo;(152)</p>

<pre><code>“[The functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, intuition) all represent a unique perspective. Thus, only by employing all four does one attain complete comprehensiveness.]”
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;And here we find such a form in Zarathustra, because Zarathustra is on the one side very clearly the archetype of the wise old man, and on the other side that concept of uniqueness. Therefore, the absolutely indissoluble interwovenness of Nietzsche himself and Zarathustra of which we have spoken.&rdquo;(152)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even when Nietzsche is Zarathustra, he is his own uniqueness, his own personal self as it were. Now, this thing should not be an archetype at the same time; the archetype should be differentiated or discriminated from the self.&rdquo; (152)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The self is always the sum total of conscious and unconscious processes. It comprehends consciousness; consciousness is included in the self like a small circle in a bigger circle. The self cannot be contained in an archetype because an archetype is merely a content, a figure, of the collective unconscious, and cannot possibly contain the thing in which it is contained.&rdquo; (153)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the self appears then, they are already in the wise old man, so to speak, and then they are sucked up and they become mana, important.&rdquo; (153)</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man is swelled up with the idea of possessing the big thing, being a hell of a fellow, getting very wise, it means that identification. And in the inflation which follows, the human being goes to hell. For one cannot possibly live as the wise old man day and night; one would be something between a corpse and a fool.&rdquo; (154)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, in the East they suppose that the perfect wise men are able to fly. That is the criterion–as long as one cannot fly, one has not attained to the summit of wisdom.&rdquo;(154)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is one of the events which very often happens to the analyst; it is one of the forms of analyst-neurosis. Analysts have very peculiar neuroses. They are infected by all the transference they get and their heads are twisted.&rdquo; (154)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another quality of the inflation by the wise old man is that one gets a mania to teach, to be a missionary, to tell people all about it and take care that plenty get into the kingdom of heaven. It always creates a sort of missionary attitude, and of course the conviction that there is no other way but this way.&rdquo; (155)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember any historical parallel to this carrying of the corpse?&rdquo;(156)</p>

<pre><code>"Yes, it is a symbol of the so-called transitus, the old term which designates the carrying of the cross in the Christian mystery for example, or the carrying of the tree in the Attis mystery, or the carrying of the dead bull which was himself by Mithras." (157)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Mithras was the white bull of the beginning of the world, the world bull, Abudabad, in Persian mythology; so he sacrificed his own bull, himself, and then he carried his own corpse.&rdquo; (157)</p>

<pre><code>"Yes, it would be the impetuosity, the uncontrolled affectivity of the primitive man." (157)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like to control our emotions because we enjoy them. We regret ourselves, we are sorry for ourselves; and the god expresses that in his peculiar face.&rdquo; (158)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Human dwellings were also burial places originally, particularly in the Near East. In Mesopotamia, for instance, houses have been excavated where the corpses of the ancestors were buried under the floors. That was done to keep the ancestral spirits in the house, or in the family, as the Eskimos often preserve the corpses in their huts in order to keep the ancestral spirits with them. It is most unfortunate when the host of ancestral spirits leave the spirit world, and that is very dangerous under primitive conditions.&rdquo;(160)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The archetype has its life in this world of consciousness through the fact that it appears in a living body, so the living body carries the archetype of the wise old man. But here it is represented as if the archetype were carrying the man, which is of course true inasmuch as an archetype is greater in size than the ego complex and therefore able to swallow it. And when the ego complex disappears in the archetype, man is the victim.&rdquo;(161)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zarathustra is not going to sacrifice himself at all; he is going to live on. He is only going to bury the man, thinking that he is thus overcoming the thing which has been so reluctant, heavy, unwilling, too clumsy, too conservative. Therefore, Zarathustra&rsquo;s identification with the jester who jumps over the hesitating rope-dancer.&rdquo; (161)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that amounts to a teaching of inflation, one could say. It would mean that you should identify with the archetype even if you sacrifice your humble humanity; you should sacrifice your humanity to the life of the archetype. That is exactly what happened in Nietzsche&rsquo;s life, and the question is whether that should go as a general symbol.&rdquo; (161)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the principle of science: science looks at the events of the world which follow in a sequence as a causal sequence. One must try to establish causality. Science thus produces sense.&rdquo; (162)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what is the jester in relation to Zarathustra?&rdquo; (162)</p>

<pre><code>"Yes, we could say the very actively negative aspect of Zarathustra. That jester is an evil demon. As Zarathustra is supposed to be the superior wise man, so the jester is correspondingly destructive and evil, and he comes up now." (162)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;You see, when you take a certain stand, when you make up your mind to something which is one-sided and therefore strike against an obstacle, then the opposite is conjured up from the unconscious, and the opposite here symbolized by a fool–and a destructive fool at that.&rdquo; (162-163)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The archetype of the wise old man is understood to be the sum total of human wisdom, and the shadow is necessarily the personification of all human foolishness.&rdquo; (163)</p>

<p>&ldquo;One is often not quite certain whether a man is wise or whether he is a great fool; and one must recognize that in foolishness there is a great deal of wisdom.&rdquo; (163)</p></div>
