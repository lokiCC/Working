<p>&ldquo;The very reason why the poetry excites one to such abandonment, such rapture, is that it celebrates some feeling that one use to have &hellip; But the living poet express a feeling that is actually being made and torn out of us at the moment. One does not recognize it in the first place; often for some reason one fears it; one watches it with keenness and compares it jealously and suspiciously with old feeling that one knew.&rdquo; (p.14)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.&rdquo;(p.31)</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had been written in the red light of emotion and not in the white light of truth.&rdquo; (p.33)</p>

<p>&ldquo;When an arguer argues dispassionately he thinks only of the argument; and the reader cannot help thinking of the argument too.&rdquo; (p.34)</p>

<p>Starting on page 34 has a very interesting and I think rather amazing description of the male psychology. It will definitely be worth reading again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly when the professor insisted a little to emphatically upon the inferiority of women, he was was concerned not with their inferiority, but with his own superiority.&rdquo;(p.34)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It (life) calls for gigantic courage and strength. More than anything, perhaps, creatures of illusion as we are, it calls for confidence in oneself. Without self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle.&rdquo; (p.35)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.&rdquo;(p.35)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever may be their use in civilized societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.&rdquo; (p.36)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet it is clear that could she have freed her mind from hate and fear and not heaped it with bitterness and resentment, the fire was hot within her. Now and again words issue of pure poetry:</p>

<pre><code>Nor will in fading silk compose,
Faintly the inimitable rose. – Lady Winchilsea" (p.60)
</code></pre>

<p>How interesting that she starts to ponder why the first and biggest of women writers all wrote novels. Page 66, this I believe is leading from her idea of writing needing to make money because women of history who had no power needed money to survive. When writing could provide that money they began to write, but they wrote novels. I believe she will go on to explain (accurately I might add) that without room to write and space and time alone they could not truly produce great poetry. Hmmm!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps it is rather Nature, in her most irrational mood, has traced in invisible ink on the walls of the mind a premonition which these great artists confirm; a sketch which only needs to be held to the fire of genius to become visible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, she has the right to do both these things if she does them not for the sake of breaking, but for the sake of creating.&rdquo;(p.81)</p></div>
