<p>&ldquo;And truly, I saw something the like of which I had never seen before. A young shepherd I saw; writhing, choking, twitching, his face distorted, with a thick back snake hanging from his mouth.&rdquo; (p. 127)</p>

<p>I believe this passage is a riddle about his soul&rsquo;s third metamorphsis. It starts with him talking to his burden the gravity who is a dwarf. I see the dwarf as a reference to the self that is not tied to the ego. That is why he tells the dwarf you or I dwarf and I is stronger. Gravity is a constant pull on humanity. This dwarf represents the constant pull of impulse on himself. It might be easier to just call the dwarf the id. I don&rsquo;t think that the use of a dwarf can be over looked though. In hindu tradition Shiva dances upon the dwarf of ignorance. This is a powerful symbol that works here as well. The dwarf which is our impulses is ignorant of reality. It constantly works to contain the ego. It constantly fights to keep the ego from climbing above itself, because the ego has the ability to understand the universe and the fact that it is something to be overcome or it will think it is everything. If the ego grows it is because of the pull of the id and then the person becomes attached to the world and to himself. After discussing with the dwarf for a bit, a dog howls. This for me is a call to the hero. It invokes the idea of child which Nietzsche names as the third metamorphosis of the soul. After this Zarathustra see&rsquo;s a shepherd (I believe that he is this shepherd. He uses this analogy because jesus was a shepherd and because the other two parts were about him trying to lead the people. He has been acting like the shepherd) choking on a black snake (The snake is a metaphor that Zarathustra creates in the very beginning when he talks about his animal friends the eagle and the snake. The snake is wisdom. So I believe that the shepherd is in fact chocking on his own wisdom.) I may have read something like this in the intro. I&rsquo;m sure its why I seem to be having such great success at understanding all of this book. Even still I believe this understanding to be interesting. I will definitely spend more time mulling this over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;–Meanwhile the shepherd bit down as my shout advised him; he bit with a good bite! Far away he spat the head of the snake – and he leaped to his feet. –</p>

<pre><code>No longer shepherd, no longer human – a transformed, illuminated, laughing being!" (p. 127)
</code></pre>

<p>By ridding himself of the wisdom on which he was choking. The shepherd soul transformed into the child&rsquo;s. He realized he was not wise. The search for wisdom was not in fact the end all. It was something which made him proud. It was the desert in which the Lion had claimed. In order to overcome the lion, he had to spit out the wisdom he was choking on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all things are baptized at the well of eternity and beyond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are only shadows in between and damp glooms and drift-clouds&rdquo; (p.132)</p>

<p>&ldquo;for they are modest even in their virtue &ndash; because they want contentment. But only modest virtue goes along with contentment.&rdquo; (p.134)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   But it is a disgrace to pray! Not for everyone, but for you and me and whoever still has a conscience in his head. For you it is a disgrace to pray!</p>

<pre><code>You know it well; you cowardly devil in you, who likes to fold his hands and lay his hands in his lap and wants to have it easier – this cowardly devil exhorts you: "There is a God!"
With that however you belong to the shade-loving variety who are never left in peace by the light; now every day you must stick your head deeper into night and mist!" (p.144)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;And all the gods laughed then and rocked in their chairs and cried: "Is godliness not precisely that there are gods but no God?&rdquo; (p.146)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sex, lust to rule, selfishness: these three have been cursed best and slandered and lied about most so far – these three I want to weigh humanly well.&rdquo; (p.150)</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what bridge does the now get to the someday? By what compulsion does the high compel itself to the low? And what commands even the highest – to grow higher?&rdquo; (p.150)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sex: a sweetish poison only for the wilted, but for the lion-willed a great fortifying of the heart, and the respectfully reserved wine of wines.&rdquo;(p.151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lust to rule: before whose gaze human beings crawl and cower and drudge and become lower than snake and swine – until at last the great contempt cries out of them.&rdquo; (p.151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lust to rule: but who would call it lust when the high longs downward for power! Indeed, there is nothing sick and addicted in such longing and descending!&rdquo; (p.151)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   That the solitary height not isolate and suffice itself eternally; that the mountain come to the valley and the winds of the height to the lowlands–</p>

<pre><code>Oh who would fine the right christening and gleaming name for such longing! "Bestowing virtue" – thus Zarathustra once named the unnameable." (p.151)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;   –the supple persuading body, the dancer whose parable and epitome is the self-joyous soul. Such self-joy of body and soul calls itself: "Virtue.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>With its words of good and bad such self-joy shields itself as if with sacred groves; with the names of its happiness it banishes from itself everything contemptible." (p.152)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;It also despises all woe-wallowing wisdom, for indeed, there is also wisdom that blossoms in darkness, a night shadow wisdom that always sighs: "All is vain!&rdquo;&ldquo;(p.152)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether a person is servile before gods and gods' kicks, or before human beings and stupid human opinions: all servile kind it spits on, this blissful selfishness!&rdquo;(p.152)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   One has to learn to love oneself – thus I teach – with a hale and healthy love, so that one can stand oneself and not have to roam around.</p>

<pre><code>Such roaming around christens itself "love of the neighbor": these words so far have produced the best lying and hypocrisy, and especially from those whom all the world found heavy.
And truly, this is not a command for today or tomorrow, this learning to love oneself. Instead, of all arts this is the most subtle, cunning, ultimate and most patient.
For one's own, you see, all one's own is well hidden; and of all buried treasures, one's own is the latest to be dug up – this is the spirit of gravity's doing.
Almost from the cradle, grave words and values are imparted to us; "good" and "evil" this dowry calls itself. For its sake we are forgiven for being alive.
And for this reason one lets the little children come to one, in order to restrain them early on from loving themselves; this is the spirit of gravity's doing.
And we – we faithfully lug what is imparted to us on hard shoulders and over rough mountains! And if we sweat, then we are told: "Yes, life is a heavy burden!"
But only the human being is a heavy burden to himself! This is because he lugs too much that is foreign to him. Like a camel he kneels down and allows himself to be well burdened." (p.154)

"All-complacency that knows how to taste everything – that is not the best taste! I honor the obstinate, choosy tongues and stomachs, which have learned to say "I" and "Yes" and "No."
But chewing and digesting everything – that is truly the swine's style! To always say hee-yah – only the ass learned that, and whoever is of its spirit! –" (p.155)

"Deep yellow and hot red: this is what my taste wants – it mixes blood into all colors. But whoever whitewashes his house betrays to me a whitewashed soul." (p.155)

"All my coming and going was a trying and questioning – and truly, one must also learn to answer such questioning! That, however – is my taste
–not good, not bad, but my taste, of which I am no longer shameful nor secretive.
This – it turns out – is my way – where is yours?" – That is how I answered those who asked me "the way." The way after all – it does not exist!" (p.156)
</code></pre>

<p>On Old and New Tablets</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told them to laugh at their gloomy wise men and at any who ever perched in warning, like black scarecrows, in the tree of life.&rdquo; (p.157)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   Where all time seemed to me a blissful mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played blissfully with the sting of freedom:</p>

<pre><code>Where I once again found my old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and everything he created: compulsion, statue, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:
For must there not exist something over which one dances, dances away? Must not, for the sake of the light and the lightest – moles and heavy dwarves exist? –" (p.158)
</code></pre>

<p>Is Zarathustra speaking about overcoming the self? – I think quite possibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;   It was there too that I picked up the word "overman&rdquo; along the way, and that the human is something that must be overcome,</p>

<pre><code>– that human being is a bridge and not an end; counting itself blessed for its noon and evening as the way to new dawns:
– the Zarathustra-words about the great noon, and whatever else I suspended above mankind like purple second sunsets." (p.158)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;This is what my great love of the farthest demands: do not spare your neighbor! Human being is something that must be overcome.&rdquo; (p.159)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever cannot command himself should obey. And though many a person can command himself, much is still missing before he also obeys himself!&rdquo; (p.159)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   And truly, it is a noble phrase that says: "what life promises us, we want to keep – for life!&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>One should not want to enjoy where one gives nothing to enjoy. And, one should not want to enjoy!" (p.159)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Everything that the good call evil must come together, in order to give birth to one truth; oh my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?&rdquo; (p.160)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   Once people believed in soothsayers and astrologers, and therefore they believed "Everything is fate; you should, because you must!&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>Then later people mistrusted all soothsayers and astrologers, and therefore they believed "Everything is freedom: you can, because you want to!"
Yes, my brothers, so far we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about the stars and the future, and therefore we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about good and evil!" (p.161)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Is there not in all life itself – robbing and killing? And for such words, to have been called holy, was truth itself not – killed?&rdquo; (p.162)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus all the past is abandoned; because it could happen one day that the rabble would become ruler and in its shallow water all time would drown.&rdquo; (p.162)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many noble ones are needed, to be sure, and many kinds of noble ones for nobility to exist! Or, as I once spoke in parables: "Precisely that is godliness, that there are gods but no God!&rdquo;&ldquo; (p.162)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   To their faces I say, even if it does not sound kind: the world resembles a human being in that it has a behind – that much is true!</p>

<pre><code>There is much filth in the world: that much is true! But the world itself is not therefore a filthy monster!" (p.164)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;But it takes more courage to make an end than to make a new verse: that all physicians and poets know&rdquo; (p.166)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the shopkeeper rule where all that is left to glitter – is shopkeepers' gold! The time of kings is no more; what calls itself a people today deserves no kings.&rdquo; (p.168)</p>

<p>&ldquo;False coasts and false securities were taught you by the good; in the lies of the good you were born and bielded. Everything has been duplicitous and twisted from the ground up by the good.&rdquo; (p.172)</p>

<p>The Convalescent</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely it is that there are words and sounds; aren&rsquo;t words and sounds rainbows and illusory bridges between things eternally separated?&rdquo; (p.175)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Illusion tells its loveliest lies about the things that are most similar, because the tiniest gap is hardest to bridge.&rdquo; (p.175)</p>

<p>&ldquo;–and how that monster crawled into my throat and choked me! But I bit off its head and spat it away from me.&rdquo; (p.175) [Alluding to the dream from Part 2 with the shepherd choking on the black snake.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you – you have already made a hurdy-gurdy song of it? Now I lie here, weary still from this biting and spitting out, sick still from my own redemption.&rdquo;(p.176)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little human being, especially the poet – how eagerly he puts his accusations against life into words! Hear him, but do not fail to hear the lust that is in all his accusations!&rdquo; (p.176)</p>

<p>&ldquo;My great surfeit of human beings – that choked me and crawled into my throat; and what the soothsayers said: "All is the same, nothing is worth it, knowledge chokes.&rdquo;&ldquo; (p.176)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your animals know well, oh Zarathustra, who you are and must become; behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence – that now is your destiny!&rdquo; (p177)</p></div>
