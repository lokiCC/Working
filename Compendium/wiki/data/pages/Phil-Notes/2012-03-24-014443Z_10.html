<b>Topic:</b> On The Vanity of Existence #Essays and Aphorism<br><br>
<p>&ldquo;The vanity of existence is revealed in the whole form existence assumes: in the infiniteness of time and space contrasted with the finiteness of the individual in both; in the fleeting present as the sole form in which actuality exists; in the contingency and relativity of all things; in continual becoming without being; in continual desire without satisfaction; in the continual frustration of striving of which life consists.&rdquo;(51)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time is that by virtue of which everything becomes nothingness in our hands and loses all real value.&rdquo;(51)</p>

<p>– These thoughts a very powerful. I relate it to the striving to find meaning in doing something when no meaning is possible since all will eventually fade. Yet, I think he is missing a deeper point. Perhaps, this to is connected to his strongly developed ego – his &ldquo;will to live&rdquo; which undoubtedly lives in our conscious selves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our existence has no foundation on which to rest except the transient present. Thus its form is essentially unceasing motion, without any possibility of that repose which we continually strive after.&rdquo;(52)</p>

<p>– The idea of life never stopping is very interesting. He continues to describe it with some great analogies (52).  His idea that we are constantly striving for something and if we get it are then bored and have to contend with that boredom mixes very well with the idea of the ever moving present. Yet, all of this is only occurring within the world of thought. The world of perception is a constant. How interesting this duality is. I want to ponder its affects on our psychology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That human life must be some kind of mistake is sufficiently proved by the simple observation that man is a compound of needs which are hard to satisfy; that their satisfaction achieves nothing but a painless condition in which he is only given over to boredom; and the boredom is a direct proof that existence is in itself valueless, for boredom is nothing other than the sensation of the emptiness of existence.&rdquo;(53)
–When I was very cynical I had thoughts very similar to this. Interesting how the weight of meaninglessness can stir the mind. Boredom is a common enemy. Yet, I&rsquo;m not sure what I think about it. I think it is more complex then his description suggests.</p></div>
