<p>&ldquo;Not the lest of the torments which plague our existence is the constant pressure of time, which never lets us so much as draw breath but pursues us all like a taskmaster with a whip.&rdquo; (42)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work, worry, toil and trouble are indeed the lot of almost all men their whole life long. And yet if every desire were satisfied as soon as it arose how would men occupy their lives, how would they pass the time?&rdquo;(43)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through all this, however, the measure of suffering increases in man far more than the enjoyment, and it is very greatly enhanced specifically by the fact that he actually knows of death, while the animal only instinctively flees it without actually knowing of it and therefore without ever really having it in view, which man does all the time.&rdquo;(45)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The animal lacks both anxiety and hope because its consciousness is restricted to what is clearly evident and thus to the present moment: the animal is the present incarnate.&rdquo; (45)</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a reliable compass for orientating yourself in life nothing is more useful than to accustom yourself to regarding this world as a place of atonement, a sort of penal colony. When you have done this you will order your expectations of life according to the nature of things and no longer regard the calamities, sufferings, torments and miseries of life as something irregular and not to be expected but will find them entirely in order, well knowing that each of us is here being punished for his existence and each in his own particular way.&rdquo; (49)
â€“ The negative tone is unfortunate since what he is writing about is truly quite brilliant. I am reminded of Joseph Campbell&rsquo;s telling of a myth in A Hero with a Thousand Faces. The myth is about a people who ask their creator for death because it is only with the addition of death that life can have any meaning. It is interesting but Schopenhauer goes on to say that it is our common misery that should create compassion for one another. That idea is not wrong; I just think the way he explains it hides its beauty behind a veil of anger. Still there&rsquo;s a lot to his ideas.</p></div>
