<p>My thoughts from this first section of the book have not all come to me yet. I can honestly say that I am blown away by the brilliance of the book. The duality of life is a very potent symbol right from the beginning. Everything Zarathustra does seems to be a reference to it. It&rsquo;s very idea invokes nature. Nature is not considered trivial rather it is clearly stated as the most important thing. Zarathustra asks the people to worship the earth not some extraterrestrial things. He points out flaws in the true faith and even calls those who preach it poisoners. It is cleverly worded. They are indeed poisoners for their dogma changes the paradigm of the human condition. This is a topic that Joseph Campbell talks a lot about. It is the disconnect with nature inherent in our society that causes so many problems and the root of this is the religions of abraham. They got it all wrong. A prophet should not be a person who is followed; he should be an example of how life could be lived.</p>

<p>There are many references to the path that Zarathustra walks. I love the symbolism inherent in that. The fact that Zarathustra sees the path better at night implies that we can not see our true path with our waking eyes. We must be guided by something inside ourselves. It is not truly something inside ourselves but rather the understanding inside ourself that everything is in us and we are in everything. A unity with the world around us. Zarathustra is in the most danger when he is in the world of the human beings. Though the book makes this danger physical, I think it is mainly symbolic. For walking in the world of men it is easy to lose sight of your path. Zarathustra comes back to the world as a child says the soothsayer but he is a transformed child one who has awaken from the sleep that is normal human life. He is a child because he has not yet learned many lessons from life. He is enlightened that is why he is awake. I believe that a human who does search for understanding and who asks the whys is inevitably awakened by those questions. Though he may find a wealth of energy there; he does not know which way to go. As he begins to explore the world of the sleeping humans he is in danger. The danger is not of losing his life, for the awakened one does not fear death. The danger is losing sight of his path and falling back into a sleep.</p>

<p>The idea of self is an illusion and reality. It is an illusion because in truth our ego does not exist especially when we consider the problem of free will. We (meaning the part of us that is our &ldquo;I&rdquo;) our an evolutionary adaptation. Our ego does not change the determinism. We just believe that we are above it. Believing that is a delusion one that strengthens the ego, last night the thought came to me that the problem of a strong ego is the impact on the natural world. Power hungry and greedy people are the result of an ego that is delusional. These men and women want to build shrines of stone so that none will forget them as if that could make their existence matter. We are an animal who has an adaption that allows us to think abstractly, one of the biggest abstractions is the idea of self. We are no less creatures of causality due to that. The ideas of praise and blame are flawed, as are good and evil. These subjective terms help us survive our world but in truth they do not exist because no thing is just what it is in the present. Everything was caused by the uncountable events that came before. All these events can not be given praise or blame because they too are just the products of events before them. It occurred to me last night that perhaps our biggest and truest problem is not the ignorance of our people but the delusional belief that we are someone. We are someone who is in fact noone. We are the duality and unity. This concept is hard and what I was talking about last night seemed to come out much smoother. I will no doubt keep working on this because this is exactly where my passion lies. This is at the heart of Campbell, Nietzsche, Jung, and I&rsquo;m sure the more I learn along this vein the more I will start to see that this truth is in so much. I know that the great impressionistic painters understood what I am not beginning to see. That is the influence that gave birth to their art. For their paintings are there but not there. An image that is unclear, one that is more because it is less. For each person or thing in the picture is without true identity because their is no true identity. Identity is a great illusion yet is the most real thing we have. I was once on this trail before and I went the wrong way. I was a fool and then I became worse than a fool. When I was a fool I thought that nothing was real. I was beginning to comprehend a deeper truth but I had made a grave mistake. Everything is real. It is not that I do not exist; it is more that I do not matter in the sense of some great importance. I do have an influence on the world and the people in my life. I will be a cause for more things in the future. If I become attached to my ego then my influence will be to continue to impact the world. I believe that understanding the ephemeral quality of human life is essential; we are but dew on the petal of a lotus leaf. If we accept we are due then we can return to the world without affecting it in a negative way. If we don&rsquo;t see ourselves as dew then we risk impacting the world and those around us with a pointless desire. The desire of immortality. I cant honestly say where this road will take me. I know that I am just starting to learn and grow on a new path. This path is very scary. Yesterday, when these thoughts were developing I was filled with a deep and powerful sorrow. That sorrow and heaviness stays with me even now. I feel almost fatalistic. The part that struck me the most yesterday was the part about the lonely one. Oh how the words resonated with me. I am the lonely one. Not just because I am without my love now. A love that feels lost. I am lonely and I have spent a long time going the wrong way. I threw myself into the moment because of the anxiety of being by myself. I have been unable to relax. I have been anxious each and every time I am alone. I do not feel stronger in fact I feel weaker. It is my pride that is dying now. I&rsquo;m not sure thats really the truth. I am not sure what is going on, but I have felt so anxious lately when I&rsquo;m alone.</p>

<p>This book is so deep. Will I be able to contain it? Am I on the path to madness and sorrow? Or am I facing deep emotions that have been repressed ones that have kept me from being comfortable and loving towards myself and my neighbor. Zarathustra says that most people are poisonous flies that bite you. I have felt their bites.</p>

<p>I just finished part 1 and I plan to read part 2 today. I will not be doing anything today other than reading and thinking. I will spend the entire day isolated and with drawn. I want to see why I am so anxious when I&rsquo;m alone. My heart still bleeds from my breakup. I am so far from over Tasha. I love her but that love causes me so much pain. I have been a jack ass. I was not myself and I was not growing. I tried to change. I tried to awaken but I could not find the way. Now I am awake and alone. I&rsquo;m lost but I feel like I&rsquo;m moving in the right direction.</p></div>
