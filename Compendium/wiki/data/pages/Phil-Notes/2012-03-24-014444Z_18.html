<p>Zarathustra comes from Zoroaster (look up more on him)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This picture of a living, complex Zarathustra and his unsettledness, his inability to rest content either in isolation or in society, his uncertainty about a form of address, his apostrophes to various dimensions of himself, his illness and recovery, are all supposed to provide us with both an archetypal picture of the great dilemma of modernity itself (the problem of affirmation, a new striking to be "higher&rdquo;), but also to inspire the kind of thoughtfulness and risk taking Zarathustra embodies.</p></div>
