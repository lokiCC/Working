<b>Topic:</b> On Women #Essays and Aphorism<br><br>
<p>I am reluctant to write down anything from this section because I do not feel like his view on woman is by any means an accurate portrayal. I can see fragments of truth buried in his prose, but it I do not accept is as a truth worth considering. Not because the truths are not in themselves intriguing nor because they have lost validity with time, but because they are fragments. His mental abilities have no doubt noticed some things of importance, but his personal feelings leave him an outsider. He does not understand the mind nor the disposition of a woman. It may be said that he speaks of the woman of his time and perhaps he describes what he sees in a clear way but he hasn&rsquo;t unearthed anything in his observations that seems to be an accurate and fair portrayal. I am of the belief that women are in no way inferior to men and that their capacities are not decided by their sex but rather by society and their upbringing. To generalize and attempt to describe woman in the same way as men I think is not a good way to approach it. They do have a tendency to dissimulate but I do not see it the same way. I agree more with the Sex Appeal documentary in that it is so they can truly judge and find an agreeable mate. I do not believe they dissimulate any more than men nor more often; I think it just appears in a different way. Schopenhauer who had terrible experiences with some of the women in his life is no doubt jaded by these and seems unable to truly appreciate women. The introduction stated that he was a bit of a womanizer.</p></div>
