<p>&ldquo;Thing in itself signifies that which exists independently of our perception, that which actually is. To Democritus it was matter; fundamentally this what it still was to Locke; to Kant it was = x; to me it is will.&rdquo;(55)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because everything in nature is at once appearance and thing in itself, or natura naturata and natura naturans, it is consequently susceptible of a twofold explanation, a physical and a metaphysical. Th physical explanation is always in terms of cause, the metaphysical in terms of will; for that which appears in cognition-less nature as natural force, and on a higher level as life force, receives in anima and man the name will.&rdquo; (56)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For can it be imagined that a connection between causes and consequences could exist in nature which is essentially and for ever undiscoverable? – No, certainly not. Nature is unfathomable because we seek after cause and consequences in a realm where this form is not to be found. We try to reach the inner being of nature, which looks out at us from every phenomenon, under the guidance of the principle of sufficient reason – whereas this is merely the form under which our intellect comprehends appearance, i.eE the surface of things, while we want to employ it beyond the bounds of appearance; for within these bounds it is serviceable and sufficient.&rdquo; (57)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That in the case of procreation we lack a couple more stages in the causal connexion makes no essential difference, for even if we had them we should still stand at last before the incomprehensible, because appearance remains appearance and does not become thing in itself.&rdquo;(57)
– That is incredibly profound. It is exactly what Hume states that causality cannot be known. It is so beautifully articulated. Truly amazing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only is our life short, our knowledge is limited entirely to it, since we can see neither back before our birth nor out beyond our death, so that our consciousness is as it were a lighting-flash momentarily illuminating the night: it truly seems as though a demon had maliciously shut off all further knowledge from us so as to enjoy our discomfiture.&rdquo;(57-58)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this complaint is not really justified: for it arises out of an illusion produced by the false premise that the totality of things proceeded from an intellect and consequently existed as an idea before it became actual; according to which premise the totality of things, having arisen from the realm of knowledge, must be entirely accessible to knowledge and entirely explicable and capable of being exhaustively comprehended by it. – But the truth of the matter is, I fear, that all that of which we complain of not knowing is not known to anyone, indeed is probably as such unknowable, i.eE not capable of being conceived&rdquo;(58)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the idea, in whose domain all knowledge lies and to which all knowledge therefore refers, is only the outer side of existence, something secondary, supplementary, something, that is, which was necessary not for the preservation of things as such, the universal totality, but merely for the preservation of the individual animal being.&rdquo; (58)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consequently the existence of things as a whole entered into the realm of knowledge only per accidens, thus to a very limited extent: it forms only the background of the painting in the animal consciousness, where the objectives of the will are the essential element and occupy the front rank.&rdquo;(58)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now since knowledge exists only for the purpose of preserving each animal individual, its adapted merely to the aims of such an individual: and these require knowledge only of relations between individual phenomena and by no means knowledge of the essential nature of things and the universal totality.&rdquo;(58)
– This entire page is brilliant. It is a clear articulation of the thoughts I have been having about conscious mind being only an overlay onto the natural world. The world is beyond the mind. The mind only exists within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For they (the metaphysical questions such as freedom of will, the beginning and end of the world, &hellip;) arise entirely out of these forms (of our intellect which is designed merely to prescribe to the individual will its motivations, i.e to indicate to it the objectives of its desires), whose object is not an understanding of the world and existence, but merely an understanding of our own aims.&rdquo; (59)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip; The intellect is physical not metaphysical, i.eE since, as appertaining to the will&rsquo;s objectivization it originates in the will, it exists only to serve the will: this service, however, concerns only things in nature, and not things lying outside and beyond nature.&rdquo;(59)
– There is more on 59 about man&rsquo;s intellect being born of a need to discover and capture food. A genetic advantage, that has had peculiar ramifications.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such an intellect will first of all become objective, but it can even go on to become to a certain degree metaphysical, or at least strive to become so: for the consequence of its objectivity is that nature itself, the totality of things, now becomes the intellect&rsquo;s subject-matter and problem.&rdquo;(60)
– I feel like this describes me personally. It describes my obsession and passion.</p></div>
