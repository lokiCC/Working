<p>Jung&rsquo;s sorites syllogism for Zarathustra:
&ldquo;In this case Nietzsche the man is the certainty: Nietzsche himself, Nietzsche the citizen, Nietzsche the anatomical and biological human being. And he is equal to that man, the rope-dancer, who falls dead and so anticipates Nietzsche&rsquo;s own fate; they are identical because their fate is identical. That is perfectly safe, a certainty.  Now we come to the second proposition. The figure second in importance is Zarathustra who is equal to the Overman; he is the Overman. The third proposition is that the buffoon, the jester, is equal to the shadow of the rope-dancer, because he follows the rope-dancer, he jumps out after him and overcomes him in the typical way that the shadow overcomes the conscious man–as for instance, when I say, &lsquo;You can assume such an artificial position if you like, but be careful that your shadow doesn&rsquo;t get you by the neck or attack you from behind.&rsquo;&rdquo; (129-130)</p>

<pre><code>                    (1) Nietzsche = Rope-dancer
</code></pre>

<p>(2) Zarathustra = Overman       (3) Jester               = Shadow of Rope-dancer</p>

<pre><code>(a) Overman = Demon             (a) Rope-dancer = Nietzsche
(b) Jester      = Demon           (b) Jester             = Shadow of Nietzsche
(c) Jester      = Overman         (c) Jester             = Shadow of Zarathustra
(d) Jester      = Zarathustra         (d) Nietzsche       = Zarathustra
(e) Jester      = Shadow of Zarathustra
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;We start the argument with proposition 2, that Zarathustra is the Overman, and under (a) I put: The Overman is equal to a demon because the Overman is a demoniacal man; he is more than man, which would be of course a demon in the antique sense of the world. (b) There is another demon in the play; the jester is described as a demon, so the jester equals the demon. And from that follows &copy; that the jester is equal to the Overman. You can also say, for instance, that the demon is the jester, and also the Overman; therefore, the jester is the Overman. If A is equal to B and B is equal to C, then A is equal to C. That is a so-called categorical conclusion or judgment.&rdquo;(130)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then another conclusion (d) is that the jester equals Zarathustra, because Zarathustra is equal to the Overman. The Overman is equal to a demon and the jester is equal to a demon; therefore, the jester is equal to the Overman and the Overman is equal to Zarathustra. You see, that follows logically; it is like mathematics. Now comes the major conclusion, the end of this particular argument. One cannot say the jester is quite equal to Zarathustra, but he is equal in his demoniacal aspect, or one could say the shadow of Zarathustra simply, the negative demoniacal side. So the jester would correspond to the shadow of Zarathustra (e). In other words, the jester is the negative side of the Overman. Therefore, it is understandable that Zarathustra says: "But they think me cold and a mocker with terrible jests.&rdquo; He there feels his identity with the jester; namely, his identity with his own shadow.&ldquo; (131)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The major proposition is now that the jester is equal to the shadow of the rope-dancer, and the conclusion of the former proposition is that the jester is equal to the shadow of Zarathustra. So one gets entirely mixed up. That needs to be explained: one cannot assume that identity at first sight–that because Zarathustra is the Overman, the rope-dancer would be an Overman.  It is apparently impossible, but we will follow up that argument. The figure in question, the rope-dancer, (a) is Nietzsche himself. Now if the rope-dancer is equal to Nietzsche himself, then it is Nietzsche himself who is jumped over or killed by the shadow. So (b) the jester is equal to the shadow of Nietzsche himself, because Nietzsche himself is equal to the rope-dancer; and the shadow of the rope-dancer is equal to the jester. But the jester is equal to the shadow of Zarathustra, the conclusion we reached here &copy;. Therefore, the end of our argument and at the same time the conclusion of the whole sorties is what?&rdquo; (131)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nietzsche the man is equal to Zarathustra. Voilà! That is black magic. We can write at the end q.e.d. You see, it means that this whole complication starts from the fact that Nietzsche is identical with Zarathustra, and it would not exist if that were not so.&rdquo;(131)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   Do you mean that it is an unconscious identity between Nietzsche and Zarathustra?</p>

<pre><code>Oh yes, I mean an identity in fact. He would not be conscious of it. If he were conscious of it, it most probably would not exist, or only partially, so there would still be an identity. The complete consciousness of a projection always destroys the identity; when you are entirely convinced, really understand that a certain thing is a projection, it can no longer be experienced as something outside of yourself." (132)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;If a complete or divine consciousness were possible, there would be no projection, which means that there would be no world, because the world is the definiteness of the divine projection.&rdquo; (132)</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to the Hindu myth, inasmuch as God dreams, he creates a world, he produces objects. But a state of complete consciousness obliterates the world.&rdquo; (132)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The assumption is in Buddhism that the attainment of perfect illumination, or consciousness, means nirvana, positive non-existence. The perfect consciousness is the complete identity with divinity. Man has returned into the deity, the world has returned to God, and nothing is because there is no object any longer.&rdquo; (132)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now of course we don&rsquo;t know whether perfect consciousness is possible, but we know that with progression and extension of consciousness, the number of known projections becomes diminished, so we assume that if consciousness were capable of still greater extension, still more projections would enter the field of our vision. We would destroy more of the world, as it were.&rdquo; (132)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the daimon is the Superman, the thing that is greater than man, yet it seems to be in man.&rdquo;(133)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, the daimon cannot be completely wiped out by the assumption that it is a mere projection or an identity with a fantasy; on the contrary you can assume that you have build a certain fantasy and that the identity would not have been if you had not made just that fantasy. But if you detach from the fantasy, from the agency which works in you, then you become aware of the extraordinary reality of the thing; only when you detach, when you make that sacrifice, do you know what it is worth. As long as you hold onto it, you don&rsquo;t know what it means, nor how it functions, and then you cannot develop and it cannot develop.&rdquo; (134)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the old principle of Heraclitus, who said to let the Ephesians have plenty of gold so that their viciousness would come to the daylight; without gold they would have to work, but if they have gold enough, they can develop their vices, and then they will become obvious.&rdquo; (135)</p>

<pre><code>[Heraclitus, himself a native of Ephesus, wrote, "May you have plenty of wealth, you men of Ephesus, in order that you may be punished for your evil ways." Philip Wheelwright, Heraclitus (Princeton, 1959), fr. 96.] (135)

<p>&ldquo;The fact that Zarathustra did not run away, but remained glued to the spot, means that he had a special relationship to that event; the rope-dancer who fell down had an intimate connection with him.&rdquo; (136)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;After a while consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him. "What are thou doing there?&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I knew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to hell: wilt thou prevent him?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>"On mine honor, my friend," answered Zarathustra, "there is nothing of all that whereof thou speaksest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any more!"'
</code></pre>

<p>This is the classical passage in Zarathustra, the prophecy, the unmistakable anticipation of the final catastrophe, his madness, where his mind or his sould was dead long before his body.&ldquo; (136)</p>

<p>&ldquo;People have concluded from that that his (Nietzsche&rsquo;s) madness was a divine mania–what the Greeks called maniá, a  divine state, the state of being filled with the god; one is entheos, the god is within.&rdquo; (137)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must free ourselves from this most unscientific prejudice that our thoughts mean something in the sense of producing something; it is a phenomenon in itself it proves nothing. A thought is a phenomenon in itself; it proves nothing.&rdquo;(139)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So our world is relative to our psyche; therefore it does matter what we say about the world, because we say it about our world.&rdquo; (139)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That of course includes the idea that our world is a projection. Inasmuch as we hurt ourselves against such projections, we assume that they are real. So we cannot say the world is our projection. It is God&rsquo;s projection; a superior being in man has made the projection. Therefore, in the East matter is called the definiteness of the divine thought. The divine thought can be vague and then the thing is not, but if the divine mind or thought is definite, it is matter&rdquo; (139)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, you can substitute the whole of theology from the statement of modern physics, because matter as we have previously understood it doesn&rsquo;t exist at all. It is utterly intangible, utterly immaterial. It becomes, and it vanishes, and the thing that really exists is a sort of energy or radiation.&rdquo; (139)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, with all these problems you wind up with antinomies or a priori categories. You need categories of judgment in order to be able to think about something at all; as soon as you think, you have already produced an existence, and if you assume that something is, you already think.&rdquo; (140)</p>

<pre><code>[Immanuel Kant did not hold that thinking created existence, but that the human understanding–not the preexistent world in itself–is the origin of space, time, causality, and other forms of perception and conception, without which the world in unintelligible.]
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;So the idea that a world returns to non-being by perfect consciousness is a philosophical idea which we have to notice; but we cannot say that this makes or destroys a world. It only makes and destroys our world.&rdquo; (140)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philosophy has very much to do with the subject, and the more you think things, the more you make them enter yourself–the more you obliterate them. You extinguish things by thinking about them; you make them unreal because you make them enter the self and then they no longer exist.&rdquo; (140)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one could also that it would be a consolation for the man Nietzsche who is a sort of Prometheus; and inasmuch as he is to tell him his worries will be soon over. For your soul is worry, if you have no soul there is no worry. &rdquo; (143)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This consolation coincides with Zarathustra&rsquo;s general teaching of the "blond beast.&rdquo; Be heroic, like a fair animal. Then you have no soul. It is bunk to have a soul. It means foolish psychological complications; therefore be heroic.&ldquo; (143)</p>

<pre><code>[the much cited "blond beast" was a phrase Nietzsche introduced in Genealogy to mean man as animal.]
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Identify with that great figure of the unconscious and get rid of all that psychology, all those distinctions which just mean worry. To get drunk with the figures of the unconscious is Dionysian; if you have read farther, you remember that the feast of the ass is a Dionysian orgy.&rdquo; (143)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cult of Dionysos it is even the main purpose to be drunk and unconscious, to end the psychological worry, to forget in the embrace of nature all things that bother you as being too small.&rdquo; (143)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Schiller&rsquo;s "Hymn of Joy,&rdquo; you find this idea of the compensation of the small misery of man through the greatness of the completely unconscious state of the Dionysian enthusiasm. In that intoxication, the god enters the mystes (priest at the mysteries).&ldquo; (143)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other way, the psychasthenic way or the introverted way, is to lock oneself away with one&rsquo;s complex, to avoid other people, to avoid intoxication in order to stare into the face of the complex and to do nothing else. That would be the Apollonian way. Of course that is not understood in the term Apollonian, but by definition it would be that way in the sense of discrimination, discriminating yourself as marked by a complex in contradistinction to all other beings.&rdquo; (143)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now here he advocates the Dionysian way. Forget yourself, be dead to yourself; your soul will die before your bodily happily enough, for then you won&rsquo;t see what happens.&rdquo; (144)</p>

<p>&ldquo;More and more the orgiastic hymn comes in. The deeper the worry, the greater the tragedy becomes, the more he loses himself in the enthusiasm of the divine mania.&rdquo;(144)</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have every experienced such a state of oblivion in your life, where only your body lives, then you know all the bliss of the Dionysian revelation.&rdquo;(144)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angelus Silesius was such a man; he lived in a time when he simply could not find his equal. Yes, if he had been able to travel to India, he would have found his equal. They would have said his truth was an old truth which they had known long ago. But nobody could understand in the West. And what happened to him? Well, he was a fellow who did not get into Dionysian enthusiasms because, as his fate shows, he locked himself away with his complex. He locked himself up literally in a monastery where he died. He lost all his beautiful poetry completely, and produced fifty-six awful pamphlets against Protestantism. He had been a Protestant and he died most miserably in a hell of a neurosis in a monastery. You see, that was the other way round: his body died before his soul, and his soul became a terrible, poisonous demon–the soul of a man who had produced” Der Cherubinishe Wandersmann,” that sweet mystic verse. And then fifty-six pamphlets against Protestantism!” (144-145)</p>

<pre><code>[Angelus Silesius (1624-1677), pen name of Johann Scheffler. The Cherub Wayfarer begins: “I know that without me / God can no moment live; / were I to die, then He / No longer could survive.” Rainer Maria Rilke’s poem “What will do you, God, if I die?” is striking similar in idea. See also CW 11, par.190.] (145)
