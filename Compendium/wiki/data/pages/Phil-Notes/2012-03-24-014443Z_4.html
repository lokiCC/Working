<p>&ldquo;The devs are the shining gods of the day, of the clear blue sky, of things visible in the daylight, while Asura is a god within, a god of chiefly spiritual and moral character.&rdquo; (6)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he (Zarathustra) is really the founder of the Christian dogma; all the oblique and contrary things in the Christian dogma can be found in the Persian religion as well.&rdquo; (8)</p>

<p>Ahura Mazda – the greatest god, the wise man
Devils come from devs (god)
Amesha spentas – immortal spirits</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, we often speak of (the old wise man) as a personification of the inherited wisdom of the ages, the truth that has become instinctive through experience, one could say, having been lived millions of times, a sort of wisdom of nature that is born in us and to which we owe the coordination of our whole biological as well as psychological system – that old experience which is still visible in our dreams and in our instincts.&rdquo;(9)</p>

<p>Saoshyants – an idea that every 1000 years a new savior or reaper is born to the world. The idea is in India, Persia, and other parts of the world. This is exactly what Virginia Woolf was talking about when she said only once every thousand years someone gets to Z. I had understood this correctly. I am blown away by the historical confirmation. I had understood Woolf correctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore the saying of Laotze:  The one who detaches and sees from afar sees clearly&rdquo; (15)</p>

<p>The entire book is quotable. I do not know how I can live without owning a copy. This is a work of unbelievable power. Jung goes sentence by sentence. Idea by idea, he discusses everything. Like why a lake of his home is mentioned – to symbolize the personal unconscious. I&rsquo;m in awe at what I&rsquo;m reading. I want to spend my life reading this stuff. I want to teach. I want to learn. I love this!</p></div>
