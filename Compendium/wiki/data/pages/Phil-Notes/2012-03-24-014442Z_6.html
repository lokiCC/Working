<p>Fine Arts In Literature</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision&rsquo; (Woolf, 226)</p>

<p>Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s novel To the Lighthouse with its closing lines seems to gain a meaning of universal optimism and metaphysical wholeness. Lily Briscoe has finished her painting. The artist has created a work of art which in itself becomes part of another work of art &ndash; the novel of the writer-artist, Virginia Woolf.</p>

<p>This essay is in search of the interdependence, the mutual influence, of painting and writing in Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s novel, To the Lighthouse. In this context it examines also her sister&rsquo;s, Vanessa Bell&rsquo;s, selected paintings, The Portrait of Lytton Strachey, Nursery Tea and The Studland Beach.</p>

<p>Fine arts and literature compete with one another, one giving birth to the other yet still determined by the other&rsquo;s existence. One is a condition for the other yet one is dependent on the other. Painting as a field of fine arts is a sister art of literature. Their co-appearance in this novel can be taken symbolically for the sister artists, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf.</p>

<p>The two sisters were very close to each other and each felt the other&rsquo;s opinion and criticism &ndash; professional as well as personal &ndash; to be extraordinarily important. In a way they were always competing with each other. Since they worked in two different fields of art their interest was always in the other&rsquo;s field as well. Yet, it is rather the influence of painting that seems obvious in the case of Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s writings than a literary influence on Vanessa Bell&rsquo;s works. The overall lyricism and the vibrating pictures of To the Lighthouse give the work a strong picturesque or &lsquo;artistic&rsquo; quality.</p>

<p>Virginia Woolf could draw on her sister&rsquo;s attitude to the arts when drawing Lily&rsquo;s complex character. Lily represents the artist with her sensitivity and shyness, with her inner struggle to gain self-confidence, and her prevailing strength of creating. The working process, the way she develops her picture about Mrs Ramsay, very much shows not only a painter&rsquo;s way of creating but that of the writer of this novel as well. The first and most important stage of creation is the mental work through which the artist organizes her thoughts and feelings and all the impressions coming from the outside world into a right order so that she could express what she wants to say in a way that is understandable to the viewer, the listener, the reader, that is, the receiver. As Vanessa Bell put it:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The artist is someone who can shape, contain, reproduce feeling and sensitivity in such a way that others can share it.&rsquo; (Spalding 1984, 211)</p>

<p>She also said: &lsquo;An aesthetic expression to attain universal meaning must be disinterested.&rsquo; (Spalding 1984, 2111) This thought of disinterestedness appeared simultaneously in painting and in literature as well. Roger Fry, the art critic and painter and a close friend of the Bloomsbury circle, adored Byzantine art for its detached beauty. He found the same characteristics in post-impressionist artists like Cezanne and Matisse, in whose paintings form, shape and colour in themselves created a compositional unity that was regarded as beautiful and still or detached.</p>

<p>Vanessa Bell, influenced by Roger Fry, also tried herself in the new, French style and found the idea of detached beauty very much to her own taste. Her The Portrait of Lytton Strachey from 1911 shows a young intellectual with a red beard and moustache sitting in an armchair looking sideways against a background of floral motifs and books. Tracing the new technique, one can find the easy flowing lines and the rich covering paint that give emphasis to the face and its expression, to the dark eyes and hair. Colour dominates the picture. The individual colours of paints come together into an overall, harmonious composition of human colour that is easy and relaxing to look at. Shape and form and colour without any movement: an everlasting image of a human being &ndash; a good friend &ndash; sitting and leaning back smoothly in his armchair. It is what Lily Briscoe is striving for in her painting and it is the vision she gains by the end of the novel.</p>

<p>Creating a work of art is an aesthetic experience. It is true for literature as well as for painting. It is a bond between the two sisters. The aesthetic experience of creating the painting stands for the aesthetic experience of creating the novel. The worrying process of composition is one and the same for both artists. They worked according to the same Bloomsbury principle:</p>

<p>&lsquo;By far the most valuable things which we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness which may roughly be described as the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects.&rsquo;
(G. E. Moore) (Bradbury 1988, 94)</p>

<p>Both artists were concerned about human relationships, intellectual and emotional.</p>

<p>The painter, Lily Briscoe, as much as Vanessa Bell could also believe what Matisse stated in 1908:</p>

<p>&lsquo;A work of art must carry in itself its complete significance and impose it upon the beholder even before he can identify the subject matter.&rsquo; (Spalding 1984, 210)</p>

<p>Vanessa Bell&rsquo;s paintings, The Studland Beach and Nursery Tea, both painted in 1912, could exemplify Matisse&rsquo;s theory. They are &lsquo;sister-pictures&rsquo; in all their arrangement schemes. Both are very plain and simple. When one glances at them, without really getting to the subject matter, one immediately has a strong feeling of quietude and sunshine. One can think that the main motif of the pictures is really this feeling. The shapes, the forms, and the colours and the whole composition are all to help express this feeling. There are human characters in both paintings, though they are not portraits of actual people, in the sense that they cannot be recognised as actual portraits. The figures are schematic, they function as pure forms in relation to each other. However, one may find the human &lsquo;story&rsquo; in them, too. In The Studland Beach all the figures turn their backs to the viewer, they are without faces, without personalities of their own. In Nursery Tea the faces have hardly any details &ndash; the composition triumphs over the details.</p>

<p>The compositions of the two paintings are quite similar. Both have strong diagonally symmetric arrangement. In The Studland Beach the diagonal part from the upper left side to the lower right corner stands for the sandy beach which is in between a dark background of the sea and the dark foreground figures in the lower left part of the composition. The mass of the foreground figures is a counterpoint to the other figures appearing on the right, along the beach, against a light tent. Drawing a line between these two masses of forms one gets the other diagonal of the picture. The proportions of the painting follow the Renaissance and Greek tradition of using the rule of golden section thus ensuring the harmony of formal composition hand in hand with a harmonious arrangement of tone and colour. The forms depicting human figures &ndash; in their stillness &ndash; resemble shapes of nature as if they had become part of the surrounding environment. No shades or lights are differentiated, thus a feeling of motionlessness and timelessness prevails.</p>

<p>In Nursery Tea the diagonal arrangement is composed around a table with a white table cloth on it. Four figures sit around the table, the diagonal cross composition is very strictly set. The fine dark linear structure of the chairs with the four figures close the cross at its arms. All the figures and objects, that is, all the forms have a fine contour of dark colour which &ndash; by separating these forms from the &lsquo;life&rsquo; surrounding them &ndash; identifies them on their own.</p>

<p>There is a detachment one can find in both paintings. It is a kind of reserve as if the figures around the table or on the beach watched themselves and the world from a distance. It can mean a state of solitude as well as a state of alienation.</p>

<p>The feeling of alienation and solitude appears in To the Lighthouse in its combined form. It is present in the first section of the novel, The Window, it is present in all the characters' minds and thoughts even before the death of Mrs Ramsay. The middle part of the novel, Time Passes, mixes every feeling up, though at the basis there remain a longing for solitude and the threat of alienation. In the last section of the novel, To the Lighthouse, in the reappearing characters' minds the feeling of loss suppresses the still present fear of loneliness. The mixed feeling of love and hatred is also present here, it vibrates in the children towards their father while they are rowing to the lighthouse.</p>

<p>In this last part of the novel the artist&rsquo;s, Lily Briscoe&rsquo;s thoughts are shared with the reader most completely, one can see with her eyes and is obsessed with her mind. One is to accompany her, the artist in her questioning herself and the questioning of the meaning of her life as an artist, the meaning of her art: &lsquo;Here was Lily, (&hellip;), wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there, playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at&hellip;&rsquo; (Woolf, 163-164)</p>

<p> &lsquo;What is the meaning of life? That was all &ndash; a simple question, (&hellip;) The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark.&rsquo; (Woolf, 175-176)</p>

<p>Or yet, there is a meaning to be found, there is a revelation:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mrs Ramsay saying &ldquo;Life stand still here&rdquo;; Mrs Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent) &ndash; this was of the nature of revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing was struck into stability. She owed this revelation to her.&rsquo; (Woolf, 175-176)</p>

<p>With the meaning found she can create her work, though it is still a painful process. Painting and writing, Virginia Woolf mixes the two on purpose &ndash; they are both works of the intellectual mind and the creating hands.</p>

<p>The moment before action, before creation needs all the intensity of one&rsquo;s inner feelings and a concentration based on these feelings consciously ordered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Always before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt.&rsquo; (Woolf, 173)</p>

<p>This confession can surely be taken from the writer, Virginia Woolf as an autobiographical one. She had an immense sensitivity, though she learnt to organize herself in her writing in a very conscious way. Writing, working to her might mean not only a profession but a therapy against the instability of her mind.</p>

<p>Does the work of art stand for its creator, or for itself? &ndash; one way or the other, it will remain. In Lily&rsquo;s words: &lsquo;&ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;She&rdquo; pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint.&rsquo; (Woolf, 195)</p>

<p>The work of art outlives its creator. But how does one know it? One&rsquo;s knowledge is very little. What does one know of the world? Lily is struggling with her thoughts:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Was there no safety? No learning by heart of the ways of the world? No guide, no shelter, but all was miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air? Could it be (&hellip;) that this was life? &ndash; startling, unexpected, unknown?&rsquo; (Woolf, 197)</p>

<p>There should be a distinction made between life and art. Art is timeless and permanent. The aesthetics of Bloomsbury is based on this distinction. Reality in Bloomsbury literature and fine arts becomes an aesthetic reality. It is Roger Fry and Clive Bell who have written most on this problem concerning fine arts. Clive Bell&rsquo;s doctrine of significant form appears in his book  Art, issued in 1913 while Roger Fry published his book, Vision and Design, in 1920. Previously, in The English Group Catalogue, published in 1912, Roger Fry states that the object is an end in itself &lsquo;as a significant form related on terms of equality with other significant forms &rsquo; (Fry 1912, 11)</p>

<p>They found their theory reassured in sixth century Byzantine and Greek art as well as in Chinese and early Egyptian art and in Sumerian sculptures.</p>

<p>Thus their theory, the aesthetics they worked out was a continuity of the tradition of previous cultures though naturally it was one that rejected the aesthetics of their fathers' generation. The impressionists' emphasis on the importance and relevance of the momentariness of reality was opposed by the new aesthetics of fine art. Victorianism was opposed in its every aspect, even The Pre-Raphaelites' aesthetics, based on a true admiration of Gothic art and of the Medieval craftsman and his craftsmanship, was refused and ridiculed by Clive Bell in his book, Art, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Pre-Raphaelite method is at best symbolism, at worst pure silliness. Had the Pre-Raphaelites been blessed with profoundly imaginative minds they might have recaptured the spirit of the Middle Ages instead of imitating its least significant manifestations. But had they been great artists they would not have wished to recapture anything. They would have invented forms for themselves or derived them from their surroundings, just as the medieval artist did. Great artists never look back. &rsquo; (Bell 1987, 186)</p>

<p>Stating this, however, he rejected partly his own theory as well. Art always has to look back, what can make a difference is only how far it looks back, to what earlier period of art history.</p>

<p>When analysing the above discussed paintings by Vanessa Bell,-Nursery Tea, The Studland Beach and The Portrait of Lytton Strachey-one can see the importance of composition, that is the placing of the objects and the relation of one form to another. Besides this role of the composition the arrangement of colours is also important. The colours and their different values indicate mass in the paintings. The composition often contains purely decorative elements of design such as the background with its floral motifs in The Portrait of Lytton Strachey. A general simplification and the moving to the abstract help to achieve the ideal, real form &ndash; in Nursery Tea &ndash; that is beyond temporariness, that can be viewed from a distance and can be taken as beautiful for its stillness and disinterested quality.</p>

<p>The aesthetic quality of Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s literary works shares certain similarities with that of fine arts. The writer &lsquo;paints&rsquo; pictures with her language in her novel To the Lighthouse. These pictures are of the quality of paintings. The first such picture in the novel is the first scene of &lsquo;The Window&rsquo;. It is a picture of mother and child, a picture of love and joy and harmony. It can be a Madonna and Son painting as well in its distant beauty and calm joy, similar to a Fra Angelico painting.</p>

<p>The mother, Mrs Ramsay, is a beautiful woman. Her admirer, the family-friend, Mr Bankes tries to put her beauty into words when saying: &lsquo;Nature has but little clay like that of which she moulded you&rsquo; (Woolf, 34). The figure of Mrs Ramsay, the fifty year old mother of eight children, depicts Julia Stephens, the mother of Virginia and Vanessa. Her death, as in the novel, was a traumatic event for Virginia and for all the family. The book thus also had a retrospective meaning when written, in 1927, for the two sisters at least.</p>

<p>Other members of the Ramsay family are also autobiographical characters, like the father-figure, Mr Ramsay, reminding the reader of Leslie Stephen. Virginia Woolf in her diary and in Moments of Being reflects upon her memories of her parents and the writing of this book: &lsquo;I believe this to be true &ndash; that I was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; writing of them was a necessary act&rsquo; (Bell 1987, 208). &lsquo;I wrote the book very quickly; and when it was written, I ceased to be obsessed by my mother. I no longer hear her voice; I do not see her.&rsquo; (Schulkind, 81)</p>

<p>Some child characters can also be identified with the Stephen children. &lsquo;Prue the Fair&rsquo; stands for Stella, &lsquo;Andrew the Just&rsquo; for Thoby and &lsquo;Cam the Wicked&rsquo; for Virginia. However, as Hermione Lee observes, Virginia is not only one character in her novel but she appears in several characters:</p>

<p>&lsquo;She &ldquo;is&rdquo; the child Rose, choosing her mother&rsquo;s jewelry in the parental bedroom; she &ldquo;is&rdquo; the adolescent Nancy, making an empire out of a rock pool and drawing on her skirts at the sight of adult passion; she &ldquo;is&rdquo; Cam in the nursery, being talked asleep by her mother; and Cam in the boat adoring and hating her father; she &ldquo;is&rdquo; also Lily, painting this book.&rsquo; (Lee 1992, XXXi)</p>

<p>The book recaptures the figures of the dead parents and the last summer of happy childhood, and the picture of the loved figures of sister and brother who died tragically young. They are eternalized in the pictures of the book &ndash; their portraits are made permanent.</p>

<p>Vanessa Bell wrote to her sister after reading the book:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It seemed to me that in the first part of the book you have given a portrait of mother which is more like her to me than anything I would ever have conceived possible. It is almost painful to have her so raised from the dead. You have made one feel the extraordinary beauty of her character, which must be the most difficult thing in the world to do. ( &hellip; ) You have given father too I think as clearly (&hellip;) it is so shattering to find oneself face to face with these two again that I can hardly consider anything else. (Spalding 1984, 219)</p>

<p>Painting and writing meet again. Mrs Ramsay when thinking of some previously heard talk has a strange vision:</p>

<p>&lsquo;and slowly those words they had said at dinner, &ldquo;The China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee&rdquo;, began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed, words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow, lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across, or to cry out and to be echoed;&rsquo; (Woolf, 130)</p>

<p>Words are colours, writing is painting.</p>

<p>Time Passes depicts the picture of the stillness of death, a feeling of emptiness and chaos: &lsquo;But the stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night, with the trees standing there, and the flowers standing there, looking before them, looking up, yet beholding nothing, eyeless, and so terrible.&rsquo; (Woolf, 147)</p>

<p>The actual deaths in the family, however, are mentioned in a beautifully reserved and detached way: &lsquo;Mr Ramsay stumbling along a passage stretched his arms out one dark morning, but, Mrs Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before, he stretched his arms out. They remained empty.&rsquo; (ibid. 140)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Prue Ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth, which was indeed a tragedy, people said. They said nobody deserved happiness more.&rsquo; (Woolf, 144)</p>

<p>&lsquo;A shell exploded. Twenty or thirty young men were blown up in France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was instantaneous.&rsquo; (ibid., p.145)</p>

<p>The Lighthouse gives the picture of &lsquo;a house full of unrelated passions&rsquo; (ibid., p.162) revisited by its dwellers. It is Lily&rsquo;s thoughts and mind that try to put the pictures and scenes of memories together and by reliving them to make a step further: &lsquo;making up scenes about them is what we call &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; people, &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; of them, &ldquo;being fond&rdquo; of them. (&hellip;) She went on tunnelling her way into her picture, into the past.&rsquo; (Woolf, 188)</p>

<p>She goes on painting her picture:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Her mood was coming back to her. One must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion, the determination not to be put off, not to be bamboozled. One must hold the scene &ndash; so &ndash; in a vice and let nothing come and spoil it. One wanted, she thought, dipping her brush deliberately, to be on a level with ordinary experience, to feel simply that&rsquo;s a chair, that&rsquo;s a table, and yet at the same time, It&rsquo;s a miracle, it&rsquo;s an ecstasy.&rsquo; (Woolf, 218)</p>

<p>James, Cam and their father also have their memories to relive and resettle in order to be able to go on, to step further. And each of them has to do it on their own.</p>

<p>Time was still. However, &lsquo;The urgency of the moment always missed its mark, words fluttered sideways and struck the objects inches too low.&rsquo; (Woolf, 193) Time has passed. With the literary portraits drawn, Virginia Woolf has finished her novel, with the portrait in paint created, Lily, the artist, has given birth to the work of art.</p>
