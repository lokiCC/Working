<p>– This entire section seems to have been influenced heavily by the Upanishads</p>

<p>I (66) – I have the desire to write a note after reading this. The meaning of this passage is not something new or shocking, but it is stated in a very hard to understand way. The passage says that there is no connection between body and soul; the soul (in the sense of a persons identity) is not something that is likely to remain after death. When this idea is accepted as a truth it is only to the error of the person, since this is not a truth it damages any shreds of truth that it may contain. My summary is not very good; I&rsquo;m tempted to write out the passage but I don&rsquo;t think its truly necessary. This would be good to look at again if I need more to think about in terms of the difference between the appearance and thing in itself and the idea of the soul and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, in everyday life, you are asked about continued existence after death by one of those people who would like to know everything but refuse to learn anything, the most appropriate and approximately correct reply is: &lsquo;After your death you will be what you were before your birth.&rsquo;&rdquo;(67)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now since this existence is essentially a personal one, the ending of the personality cannot be regarded as a loss.&rdquo; (67)
–While interesting to contemplate this is merely a superficial rhetoric in my opinion. Much like proving the existence of god through a logic and linguistic reasoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;so that neither the concept of destruction nor that of continued existence could be applied to our intrinsic and essential being, the thing in itself, of which we are the phenomenal appearance, since these concepts are borrowed from the realm of time, which is merely the form of phenomena.&rdquo;(67)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth, however, the continual coming into existence of new beings and the annihilation of already existing ones is to be regarded as an illusion produced by a contrivance of two lenses (brain-functions) through which alone we can see anything at all: they are called space and time, and in their interpenetration causality. For everything we perceive under these conditions is merely phenomenon; we do not know what things are like in themselves, i.e. independently of our perception of them. This is the actual kernel of the Kantian philosophy.&rdquo;(68)</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can one believe that when a human being dies a thing in itself has come to nothing? Mankind knows, directly and intuitively, that when this happens it is only a phenomenon coming to an end in time, the form of all phenomena, without the thing in itself being affected thereby.&rdquo;(68)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more clearly you become conscious of the frailty, vanity and dream-like quality of all things, the more clearly will you also become conscious of the eternity of your own inner being; because it is only in contrast to this that the aforesaid quality of things becomes evident, just as you perceive the speed at which a ship is going only when looking at the motionless shore, not when looking into the ship itself.&rdquo; (68-69)
– relativity</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who, by virtue of the strength of his memory and imagination, can most clearly call up what is long past in his own life will be more conscious than others of the identity of all present moments throughout the whole of time. Through this consciousness of the identity of all present moments on apprehends that which is most fleeting of all, the moment, as that alone which persists.&rdquo;(69)
– I am splitting the paragraph here because I think both parts could be analyzed separately, but their reading is enhanced when taken together.
&ldquo;And he who, in such intuitive fashion, becomes aware that the present, which is in the strictest sense the sole form of reality, has its source in us, and thus arises from within and not from without, cannot doubt the indestructibility of his own being. He will understand, rather, that although when he dies the objective world, with the medium through which presents itself, the intellect, will be lost to him, his existence will not be affected by it; for there has been as much reality within him as without.&rdquo; (69)</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this means, to be sure, that life can be regarded as a dream and death as the awakening from it: but it must be remembered that the personality, the individual, belongs to the dreaming and not to the awakened consciousness, which is why death appears to the individual as annihilation.&rdquo;(70)</p>

<p>&ldquo;An individual consciousness, that is to say a consciousness of any kind, cannot be thought of apart from a corporeal being, because cognition, which is the precondition of all consciousness, is necessarily a function of the brain – properly speaking because brain is the objective form of intellect. Now empirical reality, i.e. in the realm of phenomenon, as something secondary, as a result of the life-process, it is also secondary psychologically, in antithesis to will, which alone is primary and everywhere the original element.&rdquo;(70)</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cerebral, an animal, a somewhat more highly charged bestial consciousness, in as far as we have it in all essentials in common with the whole animal world, even if it does reach its peak in us. This consciousness is, in its origin and aim, merely an expedient for helping the animal to get what it needs.&rdquo;(71)
– This is a better way of explaining what I&rsquo;ve attempted to explain before that consciousness, thinking, is a genetic adaptation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The state to which death restores us, on the other hand, is our original state, i.e. is the being&rsquo;s intrinsic state, the moving principle of which appears in the production and maintenance of the life which is now coming to an end: it is the state of the thing in itself, in antithesis to the world of appearance.&rdquo; (71)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever therefore regrets the impending loss of this cerebral consciousness, which is adapted to and capable of producing only phenomena, is to be compared with the converts from Greenland who refused to go to Heaven when they learned there would be no seals there.&rdquo;(71)
– I like this comparison. It&rsquo;s very funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything said here rests, further, on the presupposition that we can imagine a state which is not unconscious only as one which is cognizant and moreover bears the stamp of the basic form of all cognition, the division into subject and object, into that which knows and and that which is known; but we have to consider that this whole form of knowing and being known is conditioned merely by our animal nature, which is moreover very secondary and derivative, and is thus by no means the primal state of all essential being and existence, which may therefore be quite differently constituted and yet not unconscious.&rdquo; (71)</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, then, death deprives us of intellect we are thereby only transported to our cognitionless  primal state, which is not however simply an unconscious state but rather one elevated above that form, a state in which the antithesis of subject and object falls away, because that which is to be known would here be actually and undividedly one with that which knows and the basic condition of all cognition (which is precisely this antithesis) would be lacking.&rdquo;(72)
– I see here what could I believe could be a similar idea to that of the collective unconsciousness. Since he seems to be describing a state which is everything that consciousness when we have temporal bodies is drawn from. I&rsquo;d like to explore this more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that we should in some sense or other survive death is no greater miracle than that of procreation, which we have before our eyes every day. What dies goes to where all life originates, its own included.&rdquo;(72)</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this point of view our life is to be regarded as a loan received from death, with sleep as the daily interest on this loan.&rdquo; (72)
–I really like his metaphor here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that every animal in the full prime of life seems to call to us: &lsquo;Why do you lament the transitoriness of living things? How could I exist if all those of my species which came before me had not died?&rsquo;&rdquo;(72)
– Eternal Recurrence</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would do well to make a clear distinction between metempsychosis, which is the transference of the entire so-called soul into another body, and palingenesis, which is the decomposition and reconstruction of the individual in which will alone persists and, assuming the shape of a new being, receives a new intellect.&rdquo; (73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can thus regard every human being from two opposed viewpoints. From the one he is the fleeting individual, burdened with error and sorrow and with a beginning and an end in time; from the other he is the indestructible primal being which is objectified in everything that exists.&rdquo;(73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philalethes    To answer transcendent questions in language made for immanent knowledge is bound to lead to contradictions.&rdquo; (74)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philalethes    Transcendent knowledge is that which, passing beyond all possible experience, strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves; immanent knowledge, on the other hand, is that which confines itself within the bounds of possible experience and can therefore speak only of phenomena. – You, as an individual, will come to an end with your death. But your individuality is not your essential and ultimate being, only a manifestation of it: your individuality is not the thing in itself but only the phenomenal form of it which appears under the aspect of time and consequently has a beginning and an end. Your being in itself, on the other hand, knows neither time nor beginning nor end, nor the bounds of a given individuality; thus no individuality can exclude it – it exists in everyone everywhere.&rdquo; (74)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philalethes    &hellip;Individualities are a matter of indifference to the will; it is not concerned with them, although it seems to be so, because the individual has no direct knowledge of it except in himself. The effect of this is to make the individual expend more care on preserving his existence than he otherwise would, and thereby ensure the preservation of his species. From this it follows that individuality is not a form of perfection but a limitation: thus to be free of it is not a loss but rather a gain.&rdquo; (76)
– This is an interesting defense to why we have consciousness. We have it in order to make us more attached consciously to living thus to do a better job at it.</p></div>
