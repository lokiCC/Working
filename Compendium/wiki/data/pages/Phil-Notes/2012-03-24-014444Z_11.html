<p>&ldquo;You see, that is explained psychologically by the fact that Nietzsche calls himself an atheist, for anybody who calls himself an atheist is a negative theist; naturally he would not deny a thing if he did not think it was there to be denied.&rdquo; (72)</p>

<p>&ldquo;They (the east) have the saying that a man who loves God needs seven rebirths in order to be redeemed or to reach Nirvana, but a man who hates God needs only three. And why? Because a man who hates God will think of him much oftener than a man who loves God. So the atheist hates God, but he is in a way a better Christian than the man who loves him; Nietzsche is a better Christian and far more moral than the Christians before and after him.&rdquo;(72-73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the heavenly &lsquo;powers and principalities&rsquo; of the Catholic church are really the contents of the unconscious, but at that time they projected the unconscious into the world above, and only through the descent which has taken place in the last four hundred years, has it been brought down into the lower regions, the earth, into the real bowels, the intestinal region, the kingdom of the sympathetic nervous system.&rdquo;(73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through being creative one creates the thing that has come into existence in this moment, that was in a potential existence before. And the body in a way does the same for the self; the body is the expression of a preexisting uniqueness. It is as if built up by a preexisting uniqueness; it is the realization of a unit of life.&rdquo;(73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally, that(quote above) is not the biological way of expressing it. Biological science tries to explain life through a sort of physiological causality, the causality of the chemical transformations of the body, as we try to explain the evolution of certain forms by certain climatic conditions or other physical or physiological conditions. The success of that explanation is not very great, however, on account of our profound lack of knowledge.&rdquo;(73)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, such (mutations) experiences have led modern biologists to think that there is a peculiar creative factor in life.&rdquo;(74)
– this peculiar factor is based on the fact that there are no evolutionary halfway points between species. This is because mutations occur around traits rather than a mutation on a species level. Thus the change is gradual yet sudden. Interesting how this is in itself very dualistic</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is substantiated in a way by the very awkward fact that the uniqueness of the particular movement in time in which a thing is created is characterized by certain qualities, as is proved by the fact that horoscope can give the character of an individual. If it were impossible to deduce a human character from a horoscope, then of course that whole idea of the identity of the uniqueness of the self with the uniqueness of the moment when a thing comes into existence would not be valid; but as a matter of fact you can deduce from a horoscope, you can show the character of an individual to an amazing extent.&rdquo;(75)</p>

<pre><code>{Jung expressed varying opinions about astrology. See below 13 Feb 1935, for a relatively negative account, but for a much more positive view of astrological phenomena treated not casually but synchronistically, see Complete Works 8, pars. 872-915.}

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;It is not your sin–it is your self satisfaction that crieth unto heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!</p>

<pre><code>Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated?
Lo I teach you the Superman: he is that lightening, he is that frenzy. ' " (75)
</code></pre>

<p>–These are the lines being analyzed in this section.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says &hellip; that the greatest thing one can experience is the hour of great contempt. &hellip; What do you think he means by it here?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>–Jung talks here about a portion of people who desire nothing more than to be happy, and others who desire reason over all other things; as well as other: virtue, righteousness, respectability, and pity
– "And the most wonderful of all is pity, because pity is at the bottom of Christian love. The pity for all thing living is the very essence of Buddhism also."(76)
{For Nietzsche pity "is a weakness, like every losing of oneself through harmful affect. It increases the amount of suffering in the world."(Daybreak, bookII, p.85)}footnote 8 (76)
–"Jung, who is said to have given these lecture without notes, was close."(76 footnote 7)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Now why should the hour of this contempt of all the noble ideals, the most desirable precious things, be the greatest moment in life?</p>

<pre><code>Answer: Because these qualities are only the compensation for the shadow.
Dr. Jung: So you would conclude that Nietzsche is really looking for the dark things that lurk behind all these beautiful virtues, as if they surpassed all the good mankind could desire. {In Jungian theory, the shadow is a same-sex personification of the relatively undesirable parts of the personality–ranging from the mischievous to the malicious–confrontation with which is considered essential to development. See CW 9 i, par. 14}"(76)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;So the contempt really comes from the fact that the shadow is so great and thick that one begins to despise all the virtue mankind has praised in the past. For what is it? It creates in consequence of a shadow as dark as hell, so overpowering that it is really not worthwhile to praise all those virtuous qualities; the greater reality is in the darkness and not in those ideas of beauty and light.&rdquo;(76)
– This is a very interesting idea. The idea of the shadow makes sense with the understanding that the thinking world exists in duality. This duality if not realized becomes an active player in the backgrounds of the mind. So by concentrating only on the virtues of mankind we allow the hell to develop right alongside it. This also reminds me of that quote from Hunter S. Thompson &ldquo;He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pains of being a man.&rdquo; Interesting how all these ideas are very much related in one way or another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he says your frugality in sinning cries unto heaven means that he sees those ideals as a sort of pretext or subterfuge over against the overwhelming fact of the sin in man.&rdquo;(76)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that former condition (the heavy lead-like feeling in the world that causes everything to sleep) is the Yin condition, where everything has taken form. Everything is real, concrete, indubitable; and when things have become, they go to sleep. That dormant condition means that the Yin principle has swallowed the Yang principle completely. It is like a dark cloud spread over the earth, but within that cloud is the lightning lying coiled, ready to strike. Then the Yang strikes and the cloud opens, the rain falls, the air becomes clear, the rivers begin to move, new plants come up from the parched soil, and new life is created.&rdquo;(77-78)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is not ridiculous because it is the essence of civilization or culture that it can and should resist time; it is the characteristic of anything man-made that it is able to resist the continuous dissolving activity of time and nature.&rdquo;(78)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then man has the faculty of trnsforming into the Superman, by which is not meant a man of greater virtue but a man who is simply beyond this man of today, a different creature obviously, a man who can deal with the darkness in human nature.&rdquo; (80)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whenever talk talk transforms into action there is a reason for it.&rdquo; (81)
– this applies to the analysis of dreams, philosophy, and possibly literature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is lacking in the sermon apparently; with that statement, "I teach you the Superman,&rdquo; a certain culmination is reached, and for the moment he cannot go beyond. &hellip; It is like a pause in a speech: one&rsquo;s thoughts suddenly leave one and one has to do something about it and then it turns into action, and the action must be expressive, symbolical or the spoken word.&ldquo;(82)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, when somebody says a whole mouthful and then suddenly stops and cannot find the next sentence, you can be sure that he has hit upon something in himself which caused the hesitation. &rdquo;(82)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is able to go on, but in the meantime, while Zarathustra goes on talking, the symbolic action begins to work. Now, this rope-dancer is quite obviously a relation of Zarathustra–he is his symbolic action–and I think we are quite safe in assuming that he represents Nietzsche&rsquo;s inferior side, because all the preoccupation with the rope-dancer in subsequent chapters shows that he is really concerned with that man and sees himself in him.&rdquo;(83)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Overman–a rope over an abyss.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is the answer he is giving to the doubts as to how man can get across to the Overman, by what means that change can be made, and why it should be made. Those are the doubts of the inferior man, so this is almost in the way of an admonition.&ldquo;(83)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says to himself that he loves those men who don&rsquo;t remain what they were, but who live in order to change, to live beyond themselves in order to become.&rdquo; (84)
– This line hits home for me. I think that so much of my very being responds to this because. I want to embody this very idea. I want always to change because ??? I don&rsquo;t know why? Perhaps, I&rsquo;ve hit my own unconscious snag. Perhaps this is a great area for me to explore in much more depth. I really want to remember this so I will copy it to a few different places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the starts for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Overman may hereafter arrive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t see any merit in killing the body for the sake of the spirit, and moreover, one would never be changed by sacrificing oneself merely to the spirit. His idea is that it takes greater courage, greater virtue and greater sacrifice, to live, to sacrifice oneself to the earth, to reality; for if one sacrifices oneself to the actual concrete reality, one is changed and thus one prepares the way for the Overman.&ldquo;(84)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just that to which the Lord himself alluded when he spoke of the possibility that he might be seen in the shape of the lowest of our brethren, that in the lowest of our brethren we would be able to recognize the Lord. &hellip; It is not accepted, because they only want to pity the lowest of our brethren; the idea of seeing anything of high religious value in them is much too dangerous.&rdquo;(85)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would rather accept anything in the world, any devil or any hell, than accept ourselves in our particular concreteness.&rdquo; (86)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the Overman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&hellip; The setting of the sun of all his ideals about himself; it is an extraordinary disillusion and an increase of knowledge. Without disillusion you never acquire knowledge, and without knowledge you never acquire a new consciousness, and without consciousness you never change: living unconsciously you remain forever the same.&ldquo;(86)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again the virtue of the down-going, the approach to the earth, to man as he is. And the arrow of longing is the changing, going beyond, because by accepting oneself as one is, one gets a longing to be different and that moves the whole world forward.&rdquo;(86-87)
– by accepting oneself as one is, one gets a longing to be different– this is an interesting idea.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be ourselves, because we cannot stand ourselves; therefore, we never make progress. We remain as we are because we don&rsquo;t accept the only thing which can be motive power enough to bring it about. Only when we accept the thing which is loathesome to us, have we a real will to change, not before.&rdquo;(87)
– Consider the opposite idea from this. If duality and my theory of duality is correct then the exact opposite will be as true. Thus both of these ideas work together to be a total truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This shows that it is really a self-sacrifice because you risk living on or you rick dying.&ldquo;(87)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one&rsquo;s destiny to cling to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is a very wise word because the more virtues you are looking for, the more you get away from your real task. There is only that virtue which makes you live what you are.&ldquo;(88)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, we always try to retain, to economize our lives, but he preaches an attitude that is wasteful, that wastes oneself. So it means giving the whole of oneself without restriction, again a self-sacrifice to fate, to the things that have to happen from dark reasons–a complete surrender to life and fate.&rdquo;(88)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again this attitude of out-doing oneself, of doing more than one really meant to do. It means following the impulse which is always behind everything we do, the organic instinctive impulse which has the character of a natural reaction, as all instinct has.&rdquo;(88)</p>

<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart; thus is his head only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his downgoing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That is a confession. The heart is speaking through Zarathustra, not the mind.&ldquo;(89)</p></div>
