<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This bifurcation of the world into the mundane world perceived and the transcendent, "more real&rdquo; world revealed by thinking is very probably an essential consequence of thinking as such, of the existence in the human head of a &lsquo;world of thought&rsquo;.&ldquo; (p.12)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fundamental idea is: I am and I think. From this idea there follows a second, derivative idea: there exists another world, the world I inhabit in my thinking.&rdquo;(p.12-13)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;other world&rsquo; is there, exists, as an immediate consequence of the existence of thought in the human head: and as the race accumulates experience this world of thinking becomes massively enriched, especially by comparison with the almost static state of the world of perception, the outer, physical world.&rdquo; (p.13)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it any wonder, then, that this second world, the world of thought, comes to be much more real than the physical world, that men should come to regard it as alone real, as "the real world&rdquo;?&ldquo;(p.13)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And once this step has been taken, is it not likely that the physical world will be progressively devalued for the benefit of the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world, that all the qualities in it which men find useful or interesting or dreadful will be transferred one by one to the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world as their true home, so that at last the physical world is denuded of all value and claim to veneration and becomes a mere illusion, an appearance, a veil masking that other, &lsquo;real&rsquo; world?&rdquo; (p.13-14)</p>

<p>See Sections on Judgement, Synthetic Judgement, and A Posteriori &amp; A Priori</p>

<p>Kant asks &ldquo;How are synthetic a priori judgements possible?&rdquo;(18)</p>

<pre><code>"They are the structure imposed by the mind upon the world."(19)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;His answer is as follows: The concepts &ndash; the objects of understanding &ndash; are of three types:</p>

<pre><code>a posteriori (abstracted from sense perception and applied to it)
a priori (applicable to sense perception but not abstracted from it)
Ideas, which are concepts neither abstracted from sense perception nor applicable to it."(19)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;The ultimate conclusion is that there are two worlds: the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world (the thing in itself) and the &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; world (the world of phenomena).&rdquo; (19)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schopenhauer thinks the existence of this &lsquo;I&rsquo; an absolute necessity, in the same way as the existence of an &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; world makes necessary the existence of a &lsquo;real&rsquo; world: and in face this &lsquo;I&rsquo; is the real world, the substratum of the world of phenomena.&rdquo; (20)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we also know ourselves subjectively, we have an inner consciousness of our own existence, and we possess feelings and desires. This inner world of Schopenhauer calls &lsquo;will&rsquo;: we know ourselves as will.&rdquo; (21)</p>

<p>&ldquo;My body is the phenomenal form of my will, my will is the noumenal form of my body: my body is &lsquo;appearance&rsquo;, my will &lsquo;thing in itself&rsquo;.&rdquo;(21)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of myself as will and idea, a block of stone is not aware at all: but that is the only difference between us in regard to the point under discussion: the block of stone is also noumenon and phenomenon, thing in itself and appearance, will and idea: its body and its will are one, only its will has not attained to consciousness.&rdquo; (21)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, since Kant had proved that space and time, the spatial and temporal fragmentation of the world, belonged as forms of perception only to the plane of phenomena, the noumenal plane, the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; of the thing in itself, must be one and indivisible: consequently the will in the stone and the will in me is the same will.&rdquo; (21)</p></div>
