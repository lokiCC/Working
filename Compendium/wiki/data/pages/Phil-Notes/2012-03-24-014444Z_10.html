<p>&ldquo;inflation is a pathological symptom and it only takes place when the actual creative self-renewal does not come to pass; that is perfectly obvious: an inflation is always a symptom of an inherited creative process.&rdquo;(56)
–What? I need to spend some time and think about this to make sure that I understand what he is actually saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have you on the string and you dance to their whistling, to their melody. But inasmuch as you say these creative forces are in Nietzsche or in me or anywhere else, you cause an inflation, because man does not possess creative powers, he is possessed by them. That is the truth. If he allows himself to be thoroughly possessed by them without questioning, without looking at them, there is no inflation, but the moment he splits off, when he things, "I am the fellow,&rdquo; an inflation follows.&ldquo;(57)
– The first time I read this the words caused me to doubt what he was saying, but upon reading it again I began to compare it to the Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s metaphor of the incandescent mind. I began to wonder is this not the same thing just described a bit differently then I began to take both those ideas and apply the thoughts of Schopenhauer and Kant. If we are inside our thinking world and the artist creates based on the thing in itself which exists solely outside of the thinking world. Is this not then a description of the true creation of art? Being possessed by forces that we can not describe nor truly name; this is the reason for the idea of an archetype because it is a muddled idea. It cannot be defined only observed by the most subtle approach. (Here I use the word subtle because in the Upanishads It is described as the most subtle of subtleties. One only the most subtle of minds can begin to see the traces of.) All these ideas seem to be one and the same, the act of true creation occurs when the mind becomes free of the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; and is connected to the perceiving world. Once the artist thinks about this connection or thinks about himself the link is broken because this connection is not something that can be thought about. It is beyond thought; behind thought. It both causes and homes thought and so thought can not see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old father of the church, the Bishop Synesius, said that the spiritus phantasticus, man&rsquo;s creative spirit, can penetrate the depths or the heights of the universe like God or like a great demon, but on account of that he will also have to undergo the divine punishment (reconciliation of the opposites)&rdquo;(58)
– This is an interesting idea. I think that if someone understood the creative process better than they would not create so much discord within their personality by allowing it to show. However, being that this is such a complicated and complex idea; it makes complete sense that the personality becomes inflated or warped by the experiences it has with the perceiving world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He understands that by creating beyond yourself you create the Superman, by will as it were; he even says one should will it, which shows very clearly that the Superman to him is an active creation by man. But we cannot create beyond ourselves; we would have to be gods to do that. You see, this confusion comes from the fact that he identifies in his language with the creative process. The right perspective in which to see it is that the creative process in you is not your own doing. It simply takes you and uses you; it is a different will from your own. Then you understand that it is something else, something beyond yourself that is creative. It is necessarily beyond yourself, because the creative forces were before and after the act of creation. They were when you were not, when you were unconscious; and what you produces is necessarily beyond yourself because those forces are beyond yourself.&rdquo; (61)
– again I feel as though what he is describing is a connection with perceiving world and the creation of a work of art that displays the thing in it self. The thing in it self can not be understood by our conscious minds and so it&rsquo;s description or depiction must come from outside our thinking mind. This idea is mostly inconceivable so it fits to give the creation process personification yet it is not a spirit that takes hold of you; it just feels that way. Yet, it is very much not you since we identify ourselves completely with our thinking mind. It is beyond ourselves yet very much the heart of ourselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The original natural spirit, anima naturaliter Chritiana, that flesh in which this natural Christian soul once lived, then vanished; an what remains is this hybrid of plant, a sound beginning and a ghost, a sad end of human life.&rdquo;(62)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The overman, the self, is the meaning of the earth; it consists of the fact that we are made of earth.&rdquo;(64)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The essence of the body then, constitutes the self. There is no other limitation, and as soon as you enter the world of the spirit, your self evaporates – looked at from the human point of view. Of course, from the other point of view it is eternal and cannot evaporate,  but the personal Atman in Hindu teaching is really personal; it is the spirit of this particular body, and it is the body that makes this thing particular.&rdquo;(64)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the essential metaphysical meaning of the earth that it gives specifications to things, that it makes things distinct. Objects only become distinct in space and time, where they form a mass with different chemical or physical qualities by which they can be distinguished.&rdquo; (64)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old philosophers always supposed of God that he was without an opposite, without a second one; but he needs that in order to become aware of himself.&rdquo; (64)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philosophy and religion are just like psychology in that you never can state a definite principle: it is quite impossible, for a thing which is true for one stage of development is quite untrue for another.&rdquo;(66)</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an extreme uncertainty about truth; we are confronted with the utter impossibility of creating anything which is generally true.&rdquo; (66)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He comes up as he is, inexorably, and if we suppress him he becomes worse, and this being claims recognition. That is the task, and it will lead to an entirely new valuation of man and an entirely new religious idea: the recognition of man as he really is and of the world as it really is over against a background of illusions and projections.&rdquo;(70)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that will last until the world as it is has been more or less accepted, and then that truth will become dry, most uninteresting – and something else will follow.&rdquo;(70)</p>

<p>&ldquo;These waves make the periodicity of history. Presumably they follow the months of the Platonic year, but we have only had the experience of about three months, and that is very little indeed in comparison with the fact that each Platonic year contains twenty-six thousand ordinary years.&rdquo;(70)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, we have now the change from the spring into the winter sign. That has nothing to do with the stars. It is merely a projection of a peculiar periodicity in man that probably shows itself in this change of religious and ethical values; also probably in a change of temperament or something like that, a change in the constellation of the unconscious.&rdquo;(70-71)
– I&rsquo;m blown away. Last month sometime I had discussed with Patrick starting a project exploring astrology and the personality.  A day or two later, I had a thought that maybe the constellations were named/seen because of personality traits rather than affecting personality traits. Low and behold, I think I was right in thinking that. Jung here talks about this as though it were a self evident truth. Haha, he is so amazingly brilliant, yet I agree completely with him on this idea. It more likely has to do with our internal changes then any relation to stars. This is still an area that I feel like is more or less unexplored. I am not sure if it is unexplored because it is unknowable and lies in the part of us that is unable to be contemplated. Even if that is the case then I can still explore more about it and understand how the link between the two work.</p>

<p>Wretched self-complacency:
&ldquo;It is the tendency to live and not to bother, and he was confronted with a world which was thoroughly materialistic.&rdquo;(71)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says the Overman is the sea: &lsquo;in him can your great contempt be submerged.&rsquo; &hellip; All life comes from the ocean. It is the collective unconscious. So the self (the Overman=the self) is the whole collective unconscious, the origin and the end of life, the origin of rain and of all rivers, of the whole universe, the end of all distinctness.&rdquo;(71)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not the same as &lsquo;smaller than small yet greater than great&rsquo;?&rdquo;(71)</p>

<pre><code>"Yes, that is the formula of the self: there is a peculiar correspondence with smallness and greatness. The self is all-embracing yet the smallest–a paradoxical concept which is beyond our grasp as it needs must be."
    "One of the particular attractions for Jung of the early Gnostics was their belief in a god at once before and beyond the opposition necessary for consciousness and still in complex relation to other supernatural beings. In Jung's theory, this condition of containing the opposites–small/great, male/female, etc.–was a description of the self. See CW 9 ii, ch. 4." footnote 7
