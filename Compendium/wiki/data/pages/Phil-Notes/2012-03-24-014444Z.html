<p>There’s so much I would write if I knew what the words were. So much I would try and explain if I could, but alas I do not know how to describe it. The art that I just watched has touched me. It resonates still. I am different because of it. How can I hold onto it? How can I keep this beautiful thing alive like a flower born in spring. I know in time it will die, but new flowers will grow in the land as long as I keep tending the earth. I love. I love. I love. I put a show on now, but it is nothing. It is just a display of the beauty of the earth, but I am lost in my world. Lost into a deeper world where thoughts flow without words. I am drift in the sadness of life. The very vein of life that makes life worth living. We die and yet we are not dead. We must see everything we can. We must live the life we can while we have life. We have to love when there’s someone who is worth our love. I have love for life and love for the one who makes my life brighter. I will not change back to a scab. I want to be incandescent. I will chase this like a child chasing a butterfly. I am lost in fields to green to comprehend for life’s beauty fills me. I am bursting and all I want is to hold her hand and cry. Cry for the beauty. Cry for the ephemeral quality of life. Oh what a gift I’ve been given. I have sun where once there was clouds. The clouds of control have broken and now life begins to grow in my fields. I know that I don’t make a lot of sense right now and I don;t care. I don’t care about making perfect sense. I care about love and this beautiful feeling. I want to share. I want to give a gift that makes another smile for life. Oh, what a gift. Thank you eyes for being open. Thank you ears for learning to hear. Thank you mind for coming home. Thats all for now</p></div>
