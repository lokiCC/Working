I really feel like I’m not going to finish this project anymore. I get so excited about my ideas at first and I keep coming up with more and more ideas. I think of all the great ways things can be expanded and so on. I want so much to do this, but then I have a day like today. I push myself to take a look at the project despite note really knowing what I should work on. The stage before where it was all just planning seemed a lot easier then actually working on any of the tasks I wrote down. I’m not really sure why that is. I should just pick a mini project and get to work. Then I actually start messing around a little and I end up fudging something up and more then that I realize that I have no idea what this script I found actually does. The enormity of the system I’m using sort of dawns on me and I get more and more depressed as I realize that I don’t have the foggiest idea how this script is working. It’s way too complex. It is all so foreign. I’m a bit overwhelmed and that leaves me a bit depressed. Okay, well I will try and push through. I really want to make this project work. Even if all I get out of it is a small wiki that I use personally. 

I’m just so sad right now.
