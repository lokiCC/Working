<p>What&rsquo;s so striking about these pages is the simplicity of the idea. It&rsquo;s another piece that I&rsquo;ve had a blind eye toward. Women! Women&rsquo;s role in the world is not the same. It&rsquo;s fluid; it should be in harmony with mens, but it is important. Virginia Woolf is so right when she says women are like a mirror with the power to make men seem twice their size. She&rsquo;s right that the professors who claim that women are inferior do so not because they believe in their inferiority but because there superiority to women is crucial to their idea of self. Are all men like this? Not in this day and age no, but I&rsquo;d say society still believes this way. I think that this idea is crucial to so many of my problems in life. Why I don&rsquo;t want to be another guy? Fundamentally I do not believe I am superior. Yet, the belief may very well have been caused by accident. The shear fate of not being selected by a girl when I was but a child. This anxiety created a weak self image. This weak self image was necessary for me to grow up without a mirror making me twice my normal size. Without the idea that I&rsquo;m indeed superior. Yet, my lack of confidence was a weakness one I sought to eliminate. My seeking thus brought me to a place where I found and adopted the same attitude though I never realized it. Provide! Providing for someone implies superiority. My entire up bringing hinges on this idea. My father the exponent of being the provider. My weak confidence found security in the form of a companion and in that I basked in the larger view of me. Yet the view was always fragile. I was hostile to any possible attack on it because it fundamentally was not right for me. I don&rsquo;t want a mirror making me twice my size. I&rsquo;m now finally at this point happy to be exactly my size. I don&rsquo;t want to be or seem to be any larger. I&rsquo;m content with myself. And why am I content with myself? Because of the words and notes that I&rsquo;ve taken over this month. Because of the time I&rsquo;ve spent alone learning me. The time I&rsquo;ve taken to find in myself something beautiful. That beauty is fragile, but it is an idea. If I can cultivate this beauty by acting in accord with my own views then I will birth an idea. An idea is already becoming the bliss of my life. Passion stirs within me and I am overflowing with the waters of life. I&rsquo;m in rapture with these new paths and am alive in myself. First one must learn to love oneself and somehow I&rsquo;m learning. I&rsquo;m finally learning. I fear it as much as I long for it and I gain comfort in this fear because I&rsquo;m facing it now.</p>

<p>Oh how beautiful the world has become. All because I&rsquo;m discovering how to become me and am at a point in my life where I&rsquo;m putting it to the test. Here and now at this point that is the hardest point I&rsquo;ve ever endured I am facing it alone. I am not retreating to my small comforts. I am leaping into the darkness and I am going alone. If I find company or if Tasha and I date again, it will not stop or impede what I must do alone. My own time. My own growth is essential for me.</p>

<p>This is only part of what I&rsquo;ve discovered today. The other part is that I must expand my search and scope of research. Female authors like Virginia Woolf are essential. Oh, how blind I&rsquo;ve been to be ignoring the wisdom of half the worlds population. Plus their views on the problems and psychology of humans is invaluable because it does not have the same blind spots that mine does. I could read Nietzsche forever and while I would learn so so much and it would ring so true to me. I could make the error of only seeing that piece. Missing all of the parts of life that he was blind to because his blind spots are so similar to mine. Women are essential. I will learn more, much more about as many great women artists as I can find. How refreshing I find Woolf&rsquo;s book to be. Not to mention, I see so much of the woman who I love in it. While my love for her has changed, it is only because I never truly new her. I was never awake enough to really learn or understand the kind of person she was. Well, back to my reading.</p></div>
