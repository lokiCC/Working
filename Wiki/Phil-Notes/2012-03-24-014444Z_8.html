<p>The grave digger scene is a pathological joke.</p>

<pre><code>"Now this painful aspect s pathological, and a pathological joke has a marked difference from a normal joke in that it doesn't help one to laugh from the depth of one's heart because at the same time one feels a stabbing pain somewhere. This is due to the fact that in that joke there is a breaking line,a sort of split on account of the pathological interference; something which is not a jest at all, something gruesome, horrible, is mixed up with it."(168)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;Animals always denote unconscious instinctiveness, and it is still projected into the wolves in the woods as if it were their hunger.&rdquo; (168)</p>

<p>Zarathustra doesn&rsquo;t recognize his hunger because he doesn&rsquo;t know he has a body. Zarathustra is burying the body of Nietzsche.</p>

<p>Understanding the grave-diggers part: (169)</p>

<pre><code>"They say first that the corpse he is carrying would be too unclean for their hands. That is an immense depreciation of the body. This carrion is only good for hell; it is what the devil would eat; and as the devil is the principle of utter destruction, this morsel is only good for utter destruction" (169)
"'Well then, good luck to the repast,' which means that the devil stealing the morsel of carrion will devour it–implying of course utter destruction of the body." (170)
"If Zarathustra steals the corpse from the devil, he steals it for the sake of an anthropophagous or sarcophagous meal; therefore, they congratulate him on that repast."(170)
"For it is perfectly obvious that if Zarathustra succeeds, he will eat the body. You see, that is what we said before: he has overcome the body. But it is a sort of anthropophagous act: he becomes a carrion eater, like a sarcophagus (the name of a coffin means the eater of flesh.)" (170)
"Now that is the awful joke; it sounds like a sort of battling with empty brilliant words, yet at the bottom of it is the terrible allusion to an anthropophagous tendency of Zarathustra, the tendency of the wise old man to be a vulture." (170)

<p>&ldquo;And all the &lsquo;isms&rsquo; in our day are man-eaters, not only wolves but lions and sharks. In our actual politics, human life counts for very little indeed; one of the means of persuasion is bullets and hanging. We approach social conditions that are similar to those of the Middle Ages. We have tyrants and secret police, execution without trials, and all that is done by a certain spirit, a certain &lsquo;ism,&rsquo; or a certain conviction in the name of truth.&rdquo;(171)</p>

<p>&ldquo;the German philosopher Klages is a great enemy of the spirit: he accuses the spirit of strangling life, of being murderous and depleting life of blood, and to a certain extent that is perfectly true.&rdquo; (171)</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the spirit prevails against the body, there is destruction; it has an almost infernal power.&rdquo; (171)</p>

<p>In one of Nietzsche&rsquo;s Untimely Meditations(1873-1876) a collection of four early essays. This passage occurs in the third essay, &ldquo;Schopenhauer as Educator&rdquo; (ch.3)</p>

<pre><code>"he says that one spark fallen from the eternal fire into the soul of a man searching after truth suffices to devour his entire life."(171)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;To be devoured by the spirit is just as bad as to be devoured by a wild animal: it is an act of destruction.&rdquo; (171)</p>

<p>Zarathustra says &ldquo;Hunger attacketh me like a robber,&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>"the choice of that word shows how he feels the appetite of the body; it apparently takes something away from him."(171)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;If the spirit has any actual claim, it will invariably claim all the rights of the body–quite irrespective of the fact that it has no feet without the body.&rdquo;(172)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is destructive to remain, but a certain amount of destruction is very healthy for a human being; man is then able to live normally and persist, and the spirit can be held at bay.&rdquo; (172)</p>

<p>Zarathustra comes to an old man and asks him for food. &ldquo;It is indeed the same old man to whom he comes in this moment.&rdquo; (174)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, this moment also is characterized by the hunger; he is in need of something. He realizes that all is not well and so he approaches, as it were suddenly, former convictions; it is rather doubtful here apparently, like a sort of regression, and that is the reason why he meets the former old man.&rdquo; (174)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had the experience of this world which he doesn&rsquo;t know how to cope with, and so he naturally approaches a former point of view, as if something in him said: &lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think that was perhaps more reasonable than what you are trying now?&rsquo;&rdquo;(174)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he has to beg the old man to give him food, and he is giving him bread and wine.</p>

<pre><code>Communion
</code></pre>

<p>Yes. In going back to the old man, he naturally goes back to the central mystery of late Christianity, the only thing that has retained a certain living symbolism. This makes it clear that the old man is the old Christian spirit. He is the wise old man inasmuch as he has taken form or been incarnated in the spirit of the Christian church. So what he really seeks for food is the communion.&ldquo; (174)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all spirits want bodies; they are crazy without bodies. And that is what Zarathustra wants: he wants material substance in order to communicate with people. Having no body he cannot convey his meaning to them; he is practically invisible.&rdquo; (175)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Luther defended the primitive point of view, that it was the real body and the blood, because it is utterly important that the primitive instinct of man, the anthropophagous instinct, should be satisfied. For the real communion with the qualities of human beings, particularly the psychical qualities, only takes place when you can eat them.&rdquo; (175)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The symbol of communion here, then, means Zarathustra&rsquo;s attempt to reconcile himself with the body; or one can say it is the need of the body that Zarathustra should become reconciled to it.&rdquo; (176)</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old religion, which one even might call somewhat degenerate, is more human in that respect than a later one; a new religion is apt to disregard the body.&rdquo; (177)</p></div>
