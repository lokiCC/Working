<p>&ldquo;But it is astonishing how often extraordinary situations bring out most suitable reactions from the people caught in them. This is always due to the fat that an archetype has been constellated which lifts you above yourself. It is then as if you were no longer just one, but as if you were any, a part of mankind one could say; as if that situation had occurred innumerable times already so that you reacted not as n ego of today, but like man in general who had survived these situations before.&rdquo;(22)</p>

<p>Naturally, to ordinary, normal people such things would not happen, but if there is a low threshold of consciousness, where the unconscious can easily get across, these archetypal figures come up.&ldquo;(23-24)
– Can this be a cause of neurotic behavior in people more "artistic&rdquo;. Their generally less developed consciousness that has seen the &ldquo;light&rdquo; and that may have begun to contemplate life as an illusion allows the unconscious to integrate more into the personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mythology is the text book of archetypes, of course not rationally elucidated and explained, but simply represented like a picture or a story book. But all archetypes were originally real situations&rdquo; (24)
– I have begun to think of archetypes very differently. I watched a documentary on dogs today and in it they were experimenting with dogs. Dogs are genetically set up to look to humans for visual clues, instructions, and help. These are instinctual. This is the illustration of an archetype. Dog&rsquo;s have an archetypal idea of us, formed from the centuries of working with us. Thus showing how somewhere in the mind lies memories tied to genes or something. Our minds are no doubt different. This is exactly what Jung is describing. We have these unconscious instincts that were formed over the countless generations of human kind. They affect behavior and reactions; more so in people with less developed consciousness. For consciousness can be understood in Kantian terms as mind that exists in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;. The stronger we identify with the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, the stronger our delusion is the stronger our consciousness. I wonder though if consciousness only acts as a mask or perhaps a mutation to the archetypal impulses. Thus even a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person&rsquo;s personality is affected by it; the effect is just harder to see or identify.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, when one is not understood one should as a rule lower one&rsquo;s voice, because when one really speaks loudly enough and is not heard, it is because people don&rsquo;t want to hear. One had better begin to mutter to oneself, then they get curious.&rdquo;(30)</p></div>
