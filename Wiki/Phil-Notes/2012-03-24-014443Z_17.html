<b>Topic:</b> Toni Morrison Language Quote<br><br>
<p>&ldquo;The language, only the language. … It is the thing that black people love so much–the saying of words, holding them on the tongue, experimenting with them, playing with them. It&rsquo;s a love, a passion. Its function is like a preacher&rsquo;s : to make you stand up out of your seat, make you lose yourself and hear yourself. The worst of all possible things that could happen would be to lose that language.&rdquo; (423 #Introduction to Linguistics) interview in The New Republic, March 21, 1981
– This quote started me thinking about the use of language as a way of understanding the world without subjectivity. As a way of coming to understand the thing as it is. I&rsquo;d like to think about this in the future.</p></div>
