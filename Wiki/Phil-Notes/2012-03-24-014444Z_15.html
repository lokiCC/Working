<p>Zarathustra names the three metamorphsis of the spirit. The camel, the lion and the child. The camel takes the burden of the spirit. The lion earns freedom by slaying the dragon named &ldquo;Thou shall&rdquo;. The child is the continuation of life and the &ldquo;yes, I will&rdquo;. The child is innocence, accepting it does not know anything and willing to learn.</p>

<p>On the Hinterworldly (p.20)</p>

<pre><code>"I teach mankind a new will: to want the path that human beings have traveled blindly, to pronounce it good and no longer sneak to the side of it like the sick and the dying-out." (p. 21)
</code></pre>

<p>On the Passions of Pleasure and Pain (p. 24)</p>

<pre><code>Our passions turn into virtues. A person with more than one virtue is a person in turmoil for each virtue fights with the other to be the highest virtue to the self. Each virtue is jealous of the other virtues. "Even virtues can perish from jealousy." (p. 25)
"Human being is something that must be overcome, and therefore you should love your virtues - for of them you will perish. - " (p. 25)

On Reading and Writing (p. 27)
    "Of all that is written I love only that which one writes with his blood. Write  with blood, and you will experience that blood is spirit." (p. 27)
    "Whoever writes in blood and proverbs does not want to be read, but to be learned by heart." (p.28)

"What have we in common with the rosebud that trembles because a drop of dew lies on its body?" (p. 28) ***Analyze***

"There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness." (p.28)
</code></pre>

<p>On the Tree of the Mountain (p. 29)</p>

<pre><code>"But it is with human beings as it is with this tree. 
The more they aspire to the heights and the light, the more strongly their roots strive earthward, downward, into darkness, depths - into evil." (p.29)

If I may be so bold as to interpret his words about my life. I am a noble person whose soul wished to be free. It was caged and in its prison it became tormented. When it became free it soared without thought or care and became crippled by the world. I lost the thought of the hero and have often struggled because of it. I lost touch with my personal myth where I am indeed the hero. It is this hope and thought which is needed to keep my life in perspective. To provide me with energy and move me towards growth so that I am not the cripple who soils that which he gnaws on. That is what Campbell speaks about. The idea of a personal myth is needed for me. I desire to create as all those who are noble do, but I lose touch with that because the self realizes it cannot create anything beyond itself. Yet, with patience and persistence I can come into harmony and realize how both pieces of myself can come into balance.

"If you believed more in life, you would hurl yourself less into the moment. But you do not have enough content in yourselves for waiting – not even for laziness!"(p.32) (Hmm, can I believe more in life?)

"There where the state ends, only there begins the human being who is not superfluous; there begins the song of necessity, the unique and irreplaceable melody." (p.36)

There a line where he talks about praise and blame. It is very important that he mentions that because they are products of free will. Yet, if determinism is to be believed and I see no way it cannot be, then there is no such thing as free will. Zarathustra asks when will the beast known as praise and blame, (free will), be tamed and caught. I see this as an allusion to when will we overcome this idea that we are free and accept that we are as we should be a part of the world around us. Who will be able to teach that to us?

"But tell me, my brothers: if humanity still lacks a goal, does it not still lack – humanity itself? –" (p.44)

On Love of the Neighbor (p. 44)

    Here we have a section about running to our neighbor instead of accepting that the ghost is a better thing. We run because we are afraid of the ghost. I see the ghost as the similarity between us and those who have died before us. We run from the understanding that we are everything else. We run to our neighbor and take shelter in a place where "I" can be secure. I am very guilty of this. For I fear the emptiness that can be found alone for there myself dissolves and the future is black. Yet this blackness is exactly what I am seeking.

<p>Part 1 ends with Zarathustra leaving his disciples. His leaving is an attempt to force them into journeying alone. His hopes are that he has planted the seed of knowledge and awaken them to their personal quests. He then wants to leave to those quests, but I see a problem with that. I&rsquo;m sure some of my thoughts are due to the introduction, but none the less I think that Zarathustra&rsquo;s leaving will not force his followers to begin their journey alone. Much like Jesus, once you&rsquo;re gone your words can be more freely interpreted. I&rsquo;m not saying that Jesus would have taught something different, rather I&rsquo;m thinking back to Zarathustra&rsquo;s comments about jesus dying too early. About how he died before his thoughts had a chance to mature.</p></div>
