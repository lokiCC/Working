<p>&ldquo;&hellip; But could not, sunk as he was in a grey-green somnolence which embraced them all, without need of words, in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well-wishing; all the house; all the world; all the people in it, for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something, which accounted, the children thought, for the vivid streak of canary-yellow in mustache and beard that were otherwise milk white.&rdquo; (p.19)
&mdash; Suggestion of opiate use Laudanum. So ingeniously hidden to suggest perhaps that these states of mind often experienced by &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people are very much like those experienced by an opium addict. Hmm</p>

<p>As I begin page 38, I can no longer fight off the temptation to write down some thoughts. Wow, I can see in her writing parallels to the essay I read of Schopenhauer earlier as well as to the ideas introduced in the introduction to Schopenhauer that I&rsquo;m currently reading. Before this page she describes artists, people of genius so to speak, and now on this page her comments are on the writings of one of the characters. His writings are about the reality of an object, or to put it more in the terms of Schopenhauer the description of &ldquo;the Idea&rdquo;. The concept of e two worlds is so clearly a part of her writing.</p>

<p>Could Mr. Ramsey be based on Schopenhauer? Pages 38 to 43. His outlook is clearly pessimistic. He is respected for his brilliant mind which created something at 25 the same age Schopenhauer published his book on Will. The topic that is attributed to Mr Ramsey is the very same topic that Schopenhauer discusses. His description as vain and egotistical match the author of the introductions implication. It seems to coincidental not to be connected.</p></div>
