<b>Topic:</b> Reflections on the Introduction @Philosophy<br><br>
<p>After reading more about the history of Schopenhauer, I am able to understand much more clearly his writings. The author of the introduction highlights Schopenhauer&rsquo;s strict regimented life. The fact that Schopenhauer does not often change and that ideas are carried more or less without change throughout the entirety of his life. The author also makes mention of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s desire for acclaim and recognition, which can no doubt be linked to his idea of skepticism. While a lot of his ideas are very very brilliant. His subjective understanding of things has no doubt tainted his work. His view that the world is suffering and little more, I believe is tied directly to a misunderstanding of the Upanishads. Perhaps a self-loathing for all the ego that he has. Interesting how he talks about art stemming from the world beyond perception yet he cannot as Virginia Woolf describes burn up all of the bitterness. His genius is tainted by the affects his life has had upon his mind. A situation he was never able to overcome. Yet, his work is of great consequence and I&rsquo;m sure has a lot to offer me. I&rsquo;m very excited to begin reading his writings. I will try and stay mindful of what I&rsquo;ve learned from A Room of One&rsquo;s Own as I do so to better see beyond his notions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that Schopenhauer is truly the creator of the idea of conscious/unconsciousness. I love this area that I&rsquo;m studying and will no doubt be in love for a long time to come. Yay! reading haha. (that&rsquo;s probably more appropriate in a journal entry but then again this is all journaling.)</p></div>
