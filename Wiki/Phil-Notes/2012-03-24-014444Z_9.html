<p>&ldquo;The place high up on the mountain is a high level, corresponding, as we have seen, to an intense consciousness, the level of the sun: there one is isolated. And the down-going is the approach to the lower level where one comes together with that man in oneself, the ordinary collective human being.&rdquo; (48)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in your highest differentiation, your so-called differentiated or superior functions, are you connected with other human beings, but in your inferior functions. If you could live entirely in your differentiated function you never would need any other human being; you would be under no obligations and dependent upon nobody. But where you are inferior, inefficient, you are connected with mankind. The real vital connection is always through the inferior side, the "human, all-too-human,&rdquo; as Nietzsche says. &ldquo;(48)
–This idea is very similar to that of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s in which the common link is misery. Humans should bond because of misery. One could say that the miseries in our lives are most often tied to our insecurities and our inferior side. I at least think there is a common thread between the two ideas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, any creation is a creation beyond oneself, because one is already in existence, and if anything is created it must be beyond. The essence, the very principle, of creation would be man-beyond-himself, and that is the Overman.&rdquo; (49)</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens to man when he declares that God is dead? Something must happen, because other human beings hold that God lives, declaring by that that they delegate certain of their vital processes into an impersonal sphere which they call God.&rdquo; (50)</p>

<pre><code>"One could say "responsibility" if one assumes that consciousness is increased; without consciousness there is no responsibility of course."(50)
"Inflation"(50)
</code></pre>

<p>&ldquo;For instance, we pray to the Christian God not to lead us into temptation. One of my little daughters refused to say that prayer because God should not be doing such things. We are little ants not even children, in comparison with God, and that he takes fiendish pleasure in leading us into traps is really very evil.&rdquo;(50)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are like somebody walking through a wood who thinks, when an animal crosses the path, "Why have I caused this animal to cross my path?–why have I created this animal?&rdquo;&ldquo;(51)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Formerly, we believed that God could do marvelous things and so could put peculiar thoughts into the human mind, or that evil ghosts played bad tricks, and thus we were rid of the responsibility of certain activities. But if you declare that God is dead and that there is no spook whatever, then it all your own doing; or worse still, the doing of your wife, or your neighbors, or their children, and so on.&rdquo;(51)
– I totally get it. This explanation makes so much sense in our current society. Why people hold onto God so tightly? It allows them to overlook the negative parts of human kind, ascribing them to god rather than to an individual. Wow!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But those people are perfectly unconscious, as you are unconscious: you don&rsquo;t know what you do really, because you are not God. Yet you behave as if you were.&rdquo;(51)</p></div>
