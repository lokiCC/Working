<p>Lecture VI – 13 June 1934</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea is that his head is contained in the heart and the heart talks through the head. It is simply a sort of metaphor indicating that there is a secret will in the heart, behind the head and superior to the head.&rdquo;(93)</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as the people are unable to realize what individuality is, what the self is, it is projected and there is nothing to be done about it. If it is not projected in Christ it is projected into another leader or a mythological figure, a Buddha or a new religious system.&rdquo;(95)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, of course, the number of people who are not conscious of the self, who have not begun to realize that there is such a problem, are countless. {see CW 12, par. 12, for an account of how religious projections may cut off unconscious content "from all participation and influence upon the conscious mind.&rdquo;}&ldquo;(95)</p>

<p> &ldquo;It only becomes dangerous when real love comes in between and then people run away as quickly as they can, for where God is the nearest the danger is greatest.&rdquo;(98)</p>

<p> &ldquo;You see, the Self is such a disagreeable thing in a way, so realistic, because it is what you really are, not what you want to be or imagine you ought to be; and that reality is so poor, sometimes dangerous, and even disgusting, that you will quite naturally make every effort not to be yourself.&rdquo;(99)</p>

<p> &ldquo;Therefore, the idea has been invented quite suitably that it is even very bad morally to be yourself.&rdquo;(99)</p>

<p> &ldquo;Therefore, Karpokrates rightly assumes that you cannot forgive if you don&rsquo;t forgive yourself; you cannot love if you don&rsquo;t love yourself.&rdquo;(100)</p>

<p> &ldquo;Otherwise, how can we be impartial, or how can we forgive? Therefore, that Christian love of your neighbor has become most suspect. If anybody tells me that he loves me more than himself and wants to sacrifice himself, I say: what does it cost?–what do you want afterwards? For afterwards a long account will be presented. Nature will present it because it is not unselfish; there is no such thing as unselfishness in that sense. But if you can love yourself, you will be on the way to unselfishness.&rdquo;(100)</p>

<p> &ldquo;It is such a difficult and disagreeable task to love oneself that if you can do that, you can love any toad, because you are worse than the most disgusting animal.&rdquo;(100)</p></div>
