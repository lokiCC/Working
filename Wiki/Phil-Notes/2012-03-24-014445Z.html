<b>Topic:</b> My Thoughts About "The World As Will and Representation"<br><br>
<p>As I read Schopenhauer&rsquo;s description of the common way. I had a very interesting thought. The part I am reading is on the bottom of page 187 of The World As Will and Representation. The thought I had is of the razors edge. Perhaps the division between a human of genius and a common human is not fixed. Speaking planer perhaps Schopenhauer is describing how even a man who could be genius that has a gift of imagination can follow down the wrong path. Can begin to accept things more or less as they seem.&ldquo;The ordinary man does not linger long over the mere perception, does not fix his eye on an object for long, but, in everything that presents itself to him, quickly looks merely for the concept under which it is to be brought, just as a lazy man looks for a chair, which then no longer interests him. Therefore he is very soon finished with everything, with works of art, with beautiful natural objects, and with that contemplation of life in all its scenes which is really of significance everywhere. He does not linger; he seeks only his way in life, or at most all that might at any time become his way.&rdquo; The last part seems to describe the state of mind that I held not too long ago. Just trying to find my way through life, things of beauty being trifles quickly left behind. I doubt this is the only description of the wrong path, but it leads me to ponder some interesting thing. Taking it to a bigger picture when the perceived world is no longer emphasized; the ego is overemphasized. Hmm, I like that but I need to think more about this. It could have some very interesting implications which I am sure someone has commented on here and there. I will need to find out.</p>

<p>Reading further, I have had a few additional thoughts I&rsquo;d like to write down. By strengthening the mathematical (rational) side of the brain one weakens their ability in the perceptual world. This works in the opposite directions. Perhaps, it is indeed a condition of the human mind. To strengthen one hemisphere is to weaken the other? While it may hold true in some, surely it is not the case for all. Yet, I think this occurrence is worth revisiting and investigating further.</p></div>
