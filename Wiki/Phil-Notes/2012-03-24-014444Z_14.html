<p>&ldquo;all creatures so far created something beyond themselves; and you want to be the ebb of this great flood and would even rather go back to animals than overcome human?&rdquo; [p. 5] (Analysis &ndash; So much is said in this line. Evolution, progression, transcendence. I&rsquo;d like to spend some time contemplating this idea)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth and do not believe those who speak to you of extraterrestrial hopes! They are mixers of poisons whether they know it or not.&rdquo; [p. 6]</p>

<p>First Zarathustra appeals to the people&rsquo;s minds and talks about the over man. This has several important and quotable passages from pages 6-7. Then he switches to appealing to man&rsquo;s pride. In so doing is he not showing the duality of his thoughts?</p>

<p>p14 Zarathustra makes a comment that those of the true faith hate the creative ones the most. The ones that break their tablets and rules. Artists are not accepted within the confines of the true faith. How true that is? Thinking about how Joseph Campbell talks about older religions being interpreted by poets and artists. It makes sense how the broken myth (religion) is intolerant of those very people. Very interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shall be called annihilators and despisers of good and evil. But they are the harvesters and the celebrators&rdquo; [p.14]</p>

<p>The wisest animal under the sun is the snake. A creature who&rsquo;s very image is connected with a circle. The wisest animal under the sun is the eagle; a bird who is free of the world and can soar above it. One can go above and the other under, they travel together a symbol of the duality inherent in life and nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found it more dangerous among human beings than among animals; Zarathustra walks dangerous paths. May my animals guide me!&rdquo; [15]</p></div>
