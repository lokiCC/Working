<p>&ldquo;Yes, the rope-dancer is Nietzsche&rsquo;s attempt to become the Superman&rdquo;(112)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have ten thousand good propositions but nobody shows the way to carry them out. They say; if only people did so and so, but we have to deal with man as he is, we cannot make a system or a scheme where everybody is doing his duty to the utmost. It has never been done.&rdquo;(112)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So of course when Zarathustra talks of the Overman, people are interested in the rope-dancer who is actually going to perform the great feat.&rdquo; (112)
– The power of a leader over the power of a preacher; a leader can truly take people to somewhere they would normally not go. A preacher can only influence in the background as a judge; a conscious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Nietzsche comes to an end; he doesn&rsquo;t know, for he is the figure that lives in ideas. Now, that is the archetype of the wise old man, who is a system of beautiful ideas.&rdquo;(112)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only sometimes put before you as a sort of ethical program; one ought to. But as soon as you begin to apply it, there is only a spasmodic attempt of willpower. It means a terrible effort, and you feel that it is unreal. Therefore, it is unavoidable, when the sermon becomes thin, that there should be libido (psychological energy) running over into another system, a practical system which will show how the thing is done–or how it fails perhaps.&rdquo; (113)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later on, we see that the rope-dancer is killed and Zarathustra takes care of his body, but before he dies he says to him: Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body. This is prophetic word, it prophesies Nietzsche&rsquo;s fate. His soul died in 1889 when his general paralysis began, but he lived on for eleven years more.&rdquo; (115)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in that case, who would the buffoon be?&rdquo; (115)
&ldquo;It would be the active shadow, a shadow whose power has been underrated.&rdquo;(115)
&ldquo;Therefore the whole catastrophe is predicted in the last sentence of the chapter before: &lsquo;But they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.&rsquo; They already see in him the terrible jester, this buffoon that will eventually kill the rope-dancer, because they hold that what he says of the Overman is well-nigh impossible, and if anybody should try to carry it out, he would fall dead, which happens in fact immediately after.&rdquo;(116)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shadow is as a rule inactive, a mere background, or an indication that somebody has body–three dimensions–since a thing that has not three dimensions casts no shadow. If a person is more or less complete, his shadow is visible; if it is not, you feel that person is as if painted flat upon the wall. With more or less shadow, there is more or less negation or contradiction, and without that nobody is complete. People who have only two dimensions are identical with a sort of persona or mask, which they carry in front of themselves and behind which they hide. The persona in itself casts no shadow. It is a perfectly clear picture of a personality that is above board, no blame, no spot anywhere; but when you notice that there is no shadow, you know it is a mask and the real person is behind that screen.&rdquo; (116)</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I meant to say is that Nietzsche, in as far as he identifies with Zarathustra, is a rope-dancer. Zarathustra has just preached that man ought to grow beyond himself into the Overman. But Nietzsche does not grow, he does not take roots by assimilating his shadow. Instead, he identifies with his vision, and so it all becomes a sort of trick, like walking on air. The buffoon is the shadow which is left behind, "the last man,&rdquo; the ordinary man, and because it is left behind, in the end it overtakes Nietzsche.&ldquo; (116)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, it is the crossing from one condition to another, which is a symbol of the pairs of opposites, and the way by which one gets to the Overman. And the opposites are connected by the transcendent function; that is beautifully demonstrated by the rope stretched between the two towers. Of course, that the whole thing is in the air is characteristic too.&rdquo; (117)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensitive, thinking people were tremendously shaken by all those events in France, and it was under the immediate impression of those events that Schiller discovered that problem of the pairs of opposites: the problem that man, on the one side, is a fairly civilized being, and on the other, quite barbarous. He sought a way of overcoming that condition, a way that might lead to a sort of reasonable state; and the only medicine he found was in the vision of beauty, the idea that in the contemplation of beauty you can be united with yourself.&rdquo;(118)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schopenhauer made a more heroic attempt, but he annihilates the whole world; he annuls all existence in order to settle the conflict of man, and that is going too far. It is like cutting one&rsquo;s head off because one has a headache.&rdquo;(120)</p>

<p>&ldquo;In itself the shadow has no existence; it follows very closely where they body goes, and that is of course the normal condition, as it should be. But as soon as there is a split, a disagreement with the negative qualities of man, the shadow takes a form, and it even goes so far as to separate itself from the person.&rdquo;(122)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shadow is indispensable for making the whole of a personality; nobody is whole without negative qualities. This is lightly said, but in reality it is an enormous problem, looked at from an ethical point of view. It is so difficult that no one knows no other solution practically than to shut one&rsquo;s eyes; if one doesn&rsquo;t look at it, one can live. But the moment one sees it, it is almost impossible, an insupportable conflict. If one takes the moral conflict seriously, it becomes insoluble. Therefore, people choose the way of the church or something like that, in order to escape the terrible responsibility.&rdquo;(123)</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a shadow is separated from consciousness, it always has body, reality: it is a spontaneous and active agency. And inasmuch as the separation of the ego consciousness and the shadow prevents the integration of the whole of the personality–individuation–the shadow also contains the self. Behind the shadow looms up the self, but then in a negative form. In that case, the shadow has a most destructive power; that is the origin of the demoniacal forces of the shadow. Therefore, it is so important to have the right way with it. For without the integration of the shadow there is no individuation, and no reconciliation of the pairs of opposites, because the shadow is the opposite.&rdquo;(123)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of the handicaps of the individuation process that the more you are split, the less you have free will, and then the process of individuation is inhibited.&rdquo; (124)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the demoniacal power of this buffoon is due to the fact that, being with the shadow, it is activated by the superior power of the wholeness of the self.&rdquo; (124)</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the self is the concept which expresses the totality of conscious and unconscious, and inasmuch as the unconscious is limitless, indefinable, and irrational concept, the self is necessarily also an only partially rational concept; it covers something which cannot be defined fully.&rdquo;(124)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can define the ego, the extent of consciousness, but you cannot define the unconscious, because it is infinite.&rdquo;(124)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the self is an indefinable concept because it covers the whole, the conscious and the unconscious; and inasmuch as the unconscious contains an extraordinary power, the self is an expression of that power.&rdquo; (124)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus our good intentions are always double-crossed by an unaccountable, unforeseen power which one calls chance or something like that. And we call everybody superstitious who is afraid of chance, who assumes that something ought to be done against it; we don&rsquo;t believe that anything can really interfere, because we don&rsquo;t see it. Yet the primitive man is always hellishly afraid of chance, for he knows that whatever he does can be double-crossed by whatever this cunning chance may devise.&rdquo;(126)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, we try to break its (Chance) power by saying it is blind, it just happens, but if you study it carefully, you finally reach the conclusion that chance is a very peculiar thing.&rdquo; (126)</p>

<p>&ldquo;One could say it was mere chance, but unfortunately these things don&rsquo;t happen as if they were chance. There is regularity and enormous teleology.&rdquo; (127)</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the same with the unconscious. In the words you speak by chance, the truth is what you just blurt out.&rdquo; (127)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We get into an enormous continuity with life in general, not only life in the present; it contains all the ancestral life of the past and intimations of the things to come–all of humanity. So we arrive at a conception of the self which is worldwide, a sort of conglomerate and accumulation of individual minds, and that is simply a conception of a god.&rdquo;(127)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every single individual believe in his own absolute importance, in spite of his weakness, his dullness, his unimportance; and we forget that through each human being that universal being is working and can produce the most horrible results.&rdquo;(127)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We suffer from fear in all sorts of phobias, but the reason that so many people suffer from phobias is because their fear is not in the right place.&rdquo;(127)</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are quite certain in the assumption because later on the buffoon says to Zarathustra that the next time he will jump over him too, degrading Zarathustra to the role of the rope-dancer. This substantiates our interpretation that the rope-dancer is Nietzsche himself in his own form or in the form of Zarathustra; and the buffoon is the part of the shadow that holds divine power, the power over death and life. If he chooses to jump over Zarathustra, he will do so and Zarathustra will be killed in no time, just in order to show Nietzsche himself that he is dealing here with a power as great as any god&rsquo;s power.&rdquo; (128)</p></div>
