<p>&ldquo;   &lsquo;There they stand,&rsquo; said he to his heart; &lsquo;there they laugh; they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.</p>

<pre><code>Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do they only believe the stammerer?
They have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that which maketh them proud? Culture, they call it, it distinguisheth them from the goatherds.' 
'They dislike, therefore, to hear of 'contempt' of themselves. So I will appeal to their pride.
I will speak unto them most of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is the last man!'

<p>&ldquo;You see, that feeling of not reaching his audience shows that in that inner event which is in the writer&rsquo;s mind while writing, there is a similar situation. He speaks the words and apparently something in him does not answer, something withholds his reaction. Then naturally, as a writer always does, he projects the inner fact outside of himself into his writings.&rdquo;(101-102)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one could also say that the thing which doesn&rsquo;t react in him is the collective man, because the collective man in the symbolism of the unconscious is always represented by an assembly, an audience, a crowd.&rdquo; (102)</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as a matter of fact, if you can think with concentration, you realize how much you are connected with other human beings, how little you can exist without being related, without responsibilities and duties and the relation of other people to yourself.&rdquo;(102)</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a person is quite modest and does not speak because he thinks he is not competent, people say he is proud; whereas he may be a decent fellow who doesn&rsquo;t want to make the same fuss as the other people, talking about things which they really don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;(103)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So if a man feels as the writer does in this case, talking to an audience that does not understand him at all, it means that he is not in touch with his own collective man, or he underrates or overrates something in himself. There is a lack of balance in his judgement.&rdquo;(103)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Nietzsche could not expect an immediate reaction to his sermon because it must first go into the unconscious, into the belly of collectivity, and the reaction will appear in a quarter where he did not expect it at all.&rdquo;(104)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that idea of the chaos in everybody is to him like a speech metaphor, but it is apt symbolism for the disordered condition of an unconscious that is not yet synthesized&rdquo; (106)</p>

<p>&ldquo;the star symbolizes individuation&rdquo; (106)</p>

<p>&ldquo;He describes the collective man of his day, hoping to reach them by describing them to themselves; he paints a picture of the last man for them an they think it is far away in the future, but what he describes is simply the ideal man, an ideal rationalist or the ideal opportunist.&rdquo;(108)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the action will show what it means to Nietzsche to establish a connection between the Overman and the collective man–in other words, what individuation means.&rdquo;(109)</p>

<p>– A thought:</p>

<pre><code>The power of realization sets upon the seeker and he is overcome with the power of it. He believes he has found truth and it feels like lightening so he takes it to those around him because he sees there weakness and wants to fix them. He preaches to them because he does not know how to describe his truth. Yet, the words fall lifeless at the feet of all those around him. He is struck. Consciously he blames them for the failure, but underneath he knows that what he has found is empty. Yet, it has to be empty because it is also full. A truth is only true for a moment before it becomes false. No words can describe what is indescribable. This moment profoundly impacts the seeker for now he moves against the world holding his anger to hide himself from the error of his thinking. He sets off again. What he is afraid of is himself; he sees the weakness in others that he can not see in himself. He is blind to his true form and his self is disgusting to him. Even in solitude, one can not learn to love oneself because one can never truly see oneself alone, always biased is the mirrors reflection.  
The seekers quest to understand can not be accomplished alone. He is not separate from the world. The disgusting world in whatever form it currently takes is always a part of him. For the in truth he is everything and everything is him. This statement is so watered down. Like any other statement of duality it does no justice to the subject. It gives no thoughts to the reader. It is lifeless. As cold and meaningless as steel. 
How can you describe something in such a way as to represent both of its sides? An impressionist painting paints an image that is blurred does this do it? Well, the impression of a painting allows the viewer to project his own image yet does it also hint at the negative? So many attempt to solve this by being vague, but vagueness does not do it. Sure it allows for the possibility of the thing and its opposite, but so does everything else. This is a rational attempt to understand and solve this problem. Yet the problem is with conception; how can we depict the center? Am I right in thinking that it is the central point where two ideas connect and break apart which is the most accurate portrayal of the 'thing in itself'.
